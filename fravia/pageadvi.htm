<OL>

<LI><P>Step one is to look at all the headers of the message.

News/email readers normally show only a subset of the available

headers to avoid screen clutter. Select the option that makes the

hidden headers visible. In <STRONG>Netscape</STRONG> select

<B>Options/Show all headers</B>, in <STRONG>MSWIN

Pegasus</STRONG> press <B>^H</B>, in <STRONG>Pine</STRONG> press

<B>H</B>, in <STRONG>VM</STRONG> press <B>t</B> and in

<STRONG>NewsExpress</STRONG> select <B>File/ Options/ Compose/

Include Headers</B>.  Other news/email readers have similar

options.</P></LI>



<LI><P>

Important headers are:</P>



<UL>

<LI>From:</LI><LI>Sender:</LI><LI>X-Sender:</LI>

<LI>Reply-To:</LI><LI>Errors-To:</LI><LI>Return-path:</LI>

<LI>Message-id:</LI><LI>Path:</LI><LI>Received:</LI>

</UL>



<P>

All contain a network host name that may give you a clue as to who

the spammer is. However, any or all of them may be faked. It is common

for spammers to send email from a throwaway account at one site and

solicit replies at other sites, so you may need to track down two or

more network locations. Make a list of all host names mentioned in

the headers and in the body of the message. These are the parts to the

<EM>right</EM> of the <B>@</B> sign in email addresses, between

<B>//</B> and <B>/</B> in web links, in the <EM>last</EM>

<B>Received:</B> header and at the <EM>right</EM> end of

the <B>Path:</B> between <B>!</B>'s.</P>



<P><B>Path:</B> gives the list of hosts a news item passed

through, from the poster's site at the right end to get to your site

at the left end. One or more entries on the right end may be faked so

you may need to cooperate with others to track down which host in the

<B>Path:</B> list the message was injected at.</P>



<P>Like the <B>Path:</B> header <B>Received:</B> headers

are a list of sites the message passed through in reverse order but

with only one host name per header. Again, the bottom entries (earlier

timewise) in the <B>Received:</B> list may be faked. It is also

possible for spammers to relay email via a third party so that the

<B>Received:</B> header before your site's

<B>Received:</B> headers may be a victim too. They're slack

though as they should've configured their mail servers not to relay

third party email. Some spammers also pretend to be innocent relay

sites by forging additional <B>Received:</B> headers and lying

in response to complaints; complain to the so-called `relay' site's

ISP if you suspect this is the case.</P>



<P>Since intermediate sites always <EM>prepend</EM> headers then those

higher in the list are much less likely to be forged than those

further down. 



<P>Even with normal, non-faked operation not all hosts or network

routers a message passes through are recorded in the

<B>Path:</B> or <B>Received:</B> headers. Use <B>TRACEROUTE</B>

 to get a more complete

list.</P></LI>



<LI><P>Host names usually have machine name and domain name parts. For

example <B>kryten.eng.monash.edu.au</B> has a machine name of

<B>kryten</B> and domain name of <B>eng.monash.edu.au</B>

(<B>eng</B>ineering faculty, <B>monash</B> university,

<B>edu</B>cation sector, <B>au</B>stralia) with larger

domains <B>monash.edu.au</B>, <B>edu.au</B> and

<B>au</B>. Look at your list of host names and see if you can

add some local domain names to the list by stripping machine names

from host names. This is a trial and error procedure and may not

always give a valid result.</P></LI>



<LI><P>Some of the host/domain names you've discovered may actually be

a numerical network <B>IP</B> address eg. <B>kryten</B>'s

is <B>130.194.140.2</B>. See in my <A href="links.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/links.htm">links</A> page how 

to find a host name given an <B>IP</B>

address and how to find

an <B>IP</B> address given a host name. Add any new host/domain

names discovered to your list. <B>IP</B> addresses can have

zero, one or several host names. Host names can have zero, one

or several <B>IP</B> addresses.</P>



<P>Some hosts and domains designate one or more hosts to handle any

email directed to them. Use a tool like the freeware (actually postcardware) and 

very good CyberKit (copyright 1996 by Luc Neijens, Luc, you are invited to dinner 

by fravia+ :-) 

to find out if there are any such

hosts.

</P></LI>



<LI><P><B>DIG</B> queries domain name servers for information

about the host/domain names you've found. It gives a mess of

information, most of which you can ignore. You're not normally

interested in addresses associated with the site where DIG was run (in

this case ?.monash.edu.au and 130.194.?.?) and you're also not

interested in the <B>NS</B> and other records of the name

servers that supplied the information, just the info related to the

host/domain you queried. This is in the <B>;; ANSWERS:</B>

section and is the <B>A</B> internet <B>IP</B> address

records, the <B>MX</B> mail exchanger records and the

<B>PTR</B> pointer to host name records. If they don't exist

then the <B>;; ANSWERS:</B> section will be empty or

non-existent. The <B>;; AUTHORITY RECORDS:</B> and <B>;;

ADDITIONAL RECORDS:</B> sections tell you what domain name

server[s] are responsible for the part of the domain name system (DNS)

you have queried.</P>



<P>Any email sent to the queried host/domain will initially go via one

of the hosts given by the <B>MX</B> records if they exist,

otherwise it will go to the host given by the <B>A</B>

record. If there are no <B>MX</B> <EM>and</EM> no <B>A</B>

records then email will normally bounce. The <B>MX</B> and

<B>A</B> host names may be in completely different domains. Add

any new domains to your list.</P>



<P>If an <B>IP</B> address has no corresponding hostname the

<B>SOA</B> `start of authority' record can be used to see which

hosts/domains are responsible for that part of the net.

<B>Internic.net</B> is responsible for unallocated addresses so

if you get this it usually means the queried <B>IP</B> address

is faked or in error. If there is no <B>SOA</B> record try doing

a DIG ipaddress-&gt;hostname on another <B>IP</B> address which is

in the same subnet as the one you're interested in ie. vary the last number

from 1 to 254. eg. For <B>130.194.140.37</B> you might try

<B>130.194.140.66</B>. Some machines are configured by accident or

by design to not reveal who is responsible for them. Alternatively,

look for the owner of the subnet by stripping off one or more right

elements (eg. <B>130.194.140.2</B> -&gt;  <B>130.194.140</B>

-&gt; <B>130.194</B> -&gt; <B>130</B>).</P></LI>



<LI><P>Use Cyberkit's WHOIS to find the administrative and

technical contacts for the hosts/domains/ip address ranges you've

discovered.  This will give more contact information including email

addresses. If there is more than one WHOIS entry for the domain you've

entered you'll get a list of abbreviated entries. To get full

information use an entry's key as a query string (eg. mci.net gives

keys MCI8-HST and MCI2-DOM). Add the host/domain names of the email

addresses to your list. You may need to strip off one more left

elements of each domain before you get a domain that

<B>WHOIS</B> knows about (eg. <B>eng.monash.edu.au</B>

-&gt; <B>monash.edu.au</B> -&gt; <B>edu.au</B> -&gt;

<B>au</B>). Similarly, you may need to strip off one or more

right elements of each IP address range before you get an IP address

range that <B>WHOIS</B> knows about

(eg. <B>130.194.140.2</B> -&gt; <B>130.194.140</B> -&gt;

<B>130.194</B> -&gt; <B>130</B>). <B>WHOIS</B> also

knows about company names and some user names. This <B>WHOIS</B>

covers US non-military domains only. For other domains see 

other <B>WHOIS</B> servers</A>.</P></LI>



<LI><P>Use Cyberkit's TRACEROUTE  to get a

list of sites handling messages between this web server host and each

of the host/domain's. This can take several minutes. Ideally it

should be from <EM>your</EM> mail host but this should

do. Alternatively, if you're running <B>MSWindows 95</B> it

comes with a <B>TRACEROUTE</B>; run <B>TRACERT</B> in an

<B>MSDOS</B> window. The last entry in the

<B>TRACEROUTE</B> results list should be the host/domain you're

querying. The next-to-last should be the Internet Service Provider

(ISP) for your queried host/domain.  The next-to-last for

<EM>that</EM> ISP is <EM>their</EM> ISP and so on. More than one host

at the end of the list may be owned by the spammer and so you need to

use some judgement as to whether, when you send email to one of the

hosts, you're talking to the spammer or their ISP. Add the hosts at

the end of the list together with their domains to your host/domain

list. This <B>TRACEROUTE</B> will have trouble if the test link

is heavily loaded (likely during Australian working hours). If so you

could try other web

<B>TRACEROUTE</B>'s</A>.</P>



<P>It is possible but rare for a spammer to forge the response to a

<B>TRACEROUTE</B> so that sites later in the list may be

deceptive. If you suspect this is the case you will need to complain

to all the upstream ISP's as only they can determine where the forgery

starts.</P></LI>



<LI><P>Use a <A href="searengi.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/searengi.htm">web search engines</A> to look for

references to the domain names you've found. Look for `domain'

<EM>and</EM> `www.domain' Virtually all ISP's have web sites like this

and you can use the web pages to get some idea of whether it's

actually the spammer or the ISP, together with the size, contact

addresses and the email/news policy of the ISP. In addition if it's a

<B>.net</B> domain try a <B>.com</B> domain and

vice-versa; many companies use both. Be careful though as there are

also many completely unrelated companies using domain names differing

<EM>only</EM> in the <B>.net</B> and <B>.com</B>

ending. You can check by looking at the WHOIS contact information and

the IP addresses.</P>



<P>You can also use a <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://altavista.digital.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://altavista.digital.com/'" tppabs="http://altavista.digital.com/">altavista</A> 

or <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.dejanews.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.dejanews.com/'" tppabs="http://www.dejanews.com/">Deja news</A> 

to find out other information about your target 

spammer.</P></LI>



<LI><P>You should now have a list of hosts and domains with a fair

idea of the spammer's addresses and their ISP's addresses. Send an

email to the spammer's ISP (this may or may not have the same domain

name as the spammer themselves) using the abuse@ 

address and a copy to the spammer themselves. 

In the message include a copy of the spam <EM>with

full headers</EM>, detail the reasons why you find the spam

unacceptable and request that they not do it again. 

If <B>abuse@</B> bounces send the message to

admin@, root@ or postmaster@ and additionally ask them to configure

an <B>abuse@</B> address which forwards to their person

responsible for handling net abuse. If the email addresses aren't

working you could try a <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.tpc.int/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.tpc.int/'" tppabs="http://www.tpc.int/">fax gateway</A>

or check out the <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://sunsite.oit.unc.edu/~masha/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://sunsite.oit.unc.edu/~masha/'" tppabs="http://sunsite.oit.unc.edu/~masha/">email

search FAQ</A>.</P></LI>



<LI><P>Large ISP's will generally not reply to you because they're too

busy but if they receive enough complaints (and if they are full of spammers

they usually do) it is likely the spammer will be dealt with. Most

ISP's are good net citizens because it's in their own interest to

maintain a good reputation. If you see the spam again send another

message but this time post a copy of the spam <EM>with full

headers</EM> to the

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~tskirvin/home/nana/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~tskirvin/home/nana/'" tppabs="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~tskirvin/home/nana/">news.admin.net-abuse.sightings newsgroup</A>

and let the experts have a go. You may also want to email the ISP of the ISP.

You should read the

for a week or two to get a feel on how spammers operate and are dealt

with. Be warned that these newsgroups include plenty of argumentative

and intentionally deceptive and disruptive posts from spam supporters

in addition to posts from people trying to reduce spam. Life is fight.</P></LI>

A final warning: <EM>Any</EM> message on the internet which doesn't

use strong encryption/authentication techniques like

fake. Any text you read can be ripped off another site without any notice of it.

Great part of the preceding text, and part of the following has been RIPPED OFF the very good (if a little too much 

USA oriented) page of Julyan Byrne, at http://kryten.eng.monash.edu.au/gspam.html.

near future).<BR><BR>So what people tell you and what really goes on are NOT 

THE SAME THING! Head this!<BR><BR>

<HR size=3>

<FONT size=+2>Some easy tricks to annoy the stupid commercial spammers</FONT><BR>

<FONT size=+1>The 127.0.0.1 trick</FONT><BR><BR>

When posting news items on usenet use one of the following <B><I>From:</B></I> or

<B><I>Reply-To:</B></I> addresses:

<UL>

	<LI>root@[127.0.0.1]</LI>

	<LI>root@localhost</LI>

	<LI>webmaster@[127.0.0.1]</LI>

	<LI>webmaster@localhost</LI>

        <LI>bounce@[127.0.0.1]</LI>

	<LI>bounce@localhost</LI>

        <LI>postmaster@[127.0.0.1] (<FONT color=red>*</FONT>)</LI>

	<LI>postmaster@localhost</LI>

</UL>



<B>[127.0.0.1]</B> and <B>localhost</B> are often synonyms

for `the current host'. If you're lucky the bounce addresses will

cause a bounce on the sender's machine as it tries to deliver to the

non-existent user <B><I>bounce</B></I>. The last two addresses will

cause the spam to be delivered to the email administrator of the

machine sending the spam. The first four will have analogouos effects.

If you're lucky that will be the ISP and not

the spammer themselves. So that you can be contacted make sure your

posting body includes a signature that gives your true email address,

perhaps in encoded form to confuse automated address collectors

that scan news article bodies as well as article headers.<BR>

<BR>

The simplest system seems tome to be the use of <FONT color=blue>(at)</FONT> and 

<FONT color=blue>(point)</FONT> 

inside the addresses, so that your JohnHSmith@mymail.com will be 

"translated" as JohnHSmith(at)mymail(point)com... even complete idiots 

should be able to understand this, at least I hope :-)</LI>

<A name="anchorstal"></A>

<CENTER>

<FONT size=+2>Let the stupid commercial spammers pay and stalk their 

real identities at the same time!

</FONT><BR>Letting them pay is always great fun, valid also for non-spam 

commercial advertisements... :-)

</CENTER><BR>

<LI>If the spam includes a freecall 800 phone

number (States) or a 'green' number (European Union) then, by 

all means, use it. They are paying for that number

and this transfers the costs where they belong. Keep in mind that freecall

numbers frequently use unblockable caller-id to get the caller's phone

number so you may want to freecall from a public phone. Repeatedly dial 

these phone numbers as this is NOT illegal if you have forgotten to ask 

them something :-)<BR>Just keep handy a list of freecalls spammers number and 

use it as soon as you have to wait for a plane or a train or someone 

or else you happen to have some free time where there are some public phones<BR>Be wary of non-freecalls 

numbers, as some area codes that are apparently local are actually

international and have exorbitant charge scams associated with

them... all probmlems will be avoided if you use a public phone.<BR>

This technique is themost elementary technique used in order to stalk 

the spammers: act like an ineterested client in whatever the stupid 

spammer would like to sell, and get (social engineering elementary techniques, of course) 

real info out of them, inputting to them totally faked info and data. It's very 

easy, as you will see, and you'll 

get them. You'll annoy them just calling, but if you enjoy going the whole way, then 

 do prepare some valid amexco/visa card numbers (you'll find on 

the web as many fake credit card numbers generators as you want) and have 

a couple of credible faked identities (best ones are 'immigrant' identities: 

when you fake an address and that address (and the

 telephone number you have given) are possibly going to be checked, use some name (and 

people) like 'Wong' or 'Kiczielsky', or

 'M'bungo' and give address (and corresponding telephone) in a huge house 

full of people that barely speak English (or

  German, or Italian, or whatever you are siupposed to speak). 

You'll find a lot of these 'anonymity

 baits' with a little social engineering. Such 'refugees' decoys are the best thing 

you can use when you are covering your

 tracks and/or faking addresses: confronted with a family of 25 

immigrants that do not speak the country language nor

 understand what the cuckoo is going on, the card society agents 

themselves won't be able to understand if there was -or not- 

any malicious intent :-)<BR><BR>

Ok, now you have your target, a fake credit card and a fake (yet existing) identity... order everything 

they sell and let them deliver it to some impossible address, like your local 

police station, an abandoned building or another spammer's real address (this is the 

most funny destination IMHO)</LI>

gladly give you as many (faked) emails as you need!<BR><BR>So start preparing five 

email addresses, say IvanBilibin@hotmail.com IvanBilibin_@hotmail.com IvanBilibin__@hotmail.com 

and so on... and use them accordingly to the 'spam risk': the more underscore, the higher the 

spam risk... d'you dig it? Of course you will NEVER use your REALLY USED address for any 

web-transaction, nor it will EVER figure on any usenet 

group... <I>cela va sans dire</I>... note that you can have a couple of "luring" addresses, 

but that's another 'advanced stalking' matter... </LI>

<BR><BR>

<LI>Use special email addresses that are only valid for a limited time

period, that are only valid when used by a particular correspondent or

are only valid for a single return email message. These approaches

require sophisticated use of email filtering programs and probably

only make sense for somebody technically literate and with a high

volume of junk.</LI><BR>

<BR> Study eudora's filter help files... note how one of the 

MOST ADVANCED filtering applications that exist: Micro$oft's Exchange, does 

NOT explain you how to use its powerful filter assistants :-(
