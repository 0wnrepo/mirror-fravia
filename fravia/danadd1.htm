<BR><BR>                                         

                                                                                                            

Well well well... what d'you eat actually?                                                                                                                                                                 

I'll tell you. In this society, whose only aim is profit, you are probably eating                                                                                                                                      

foods that may kill you. No, I'm not speaking of the 

most evident problems, like the 'mad cow' disease (more profit for the nice master 

if he does not 

kill or denounce his ill animals)<BR>And, no, I'm not speaking of the hormones 

either, commonly used both 

in the States (legally) and in the European Union (illegally) to mast cows, pigs, 

whatever can be thus made to grow (and produce profits) more quickly.<BR>

And, er no, I'm not speaking of the pesticides residuates in many food products either (since 

the nice peasants want to make a little profit too, don't they... and, man, there are 

so many cheap pesticides on the markt!).<BR>And -see- I'm not 

sepaking about the dangerous lurking future either, with nice big  

pigs with more ribs and legs than nature cared and six legged genetic engineered 

chickens that eat cloned fat blue worms before being roasted for your kids (I'm afraid that 

we'll have to genetically reverse engineer our food :-)... (btw... allergenicity of foods produced by genetic modification 

has been already scientifically proved, see  Critical reviews in food science and nutriton

Vol. 36, Supplement, 1996)<BR>No, gentle readers, I'm speaking today 

of LEGALLY AUTHORIZED killer agents. I'm speaking of dangers that you can SEE and AVOID, if you 

just reverse (and study) a little the world around you.  

</P><P>

Food labelling has always been object of fierce struggles between regulators (that at times wish 

to limit, at least 

a little, the 'licence to kill' of the big food processing corporations) and 

the food producers and resellers, that want -obviously- just to make profit, if necessary 

over the dead bodies of their own customers.</P><P>

Reading the European Union's directives on food labelling, it is pretty easy to 

see how much any proposed increase in 'transparence' on food labels annoys 

the 'market forces' and the 'experts 

of the concerned sectors': these pigs don't WANT you to know what's inside their products... 

since -to make just an example- if you really knew what's inside -say- the 

'Jucca' cheese (produced by Kraft) you wouldn't dream to touch such a garbage with a 

badger pole, 'geschweige denn' to buy it.</P><P>

In fact the 'market forces' are annoyed by the food labels themselves: I remember that when 

the 'end date' on food products became compulsory in Europe they tried to 

avoid this and had success in delaying the introduction of the compulsory 'end date' 

labelling for years.<BR>Nota bene that this same compulsory labelled "End date" 

which is calculated BY THE PRODUCERS for obvious commercial reasons at the very limit of deperibility 

is 

eufemistically called 'best before' in many (stupid) States... as if the producers had 

any interest in leaving you graciously some more days 'allowance' 

instead of putting as 'end date' the (already 

thin stretched) maximal time duration before their product begins to make worms or worse.                                                                                                                                                

</P><P>                                                                                                                                                                                                    

Here a list of food additives allowed by the European Union (which has                                                                                                                                     

      among the BEST standards on the planet, you can imagine what for additives                                                                                                                           

     you'll find in -say- Kuala Lumpur or Ulan Bator :-(                                                                                                                                                   

 </P><P>                                                                                                                                                                                                   

Some of these additivies are QUITE DANGEROUS for ANYBODY.                                                                                                                                                  

                                Others are QUITE dangerous for kids. (In which case I would say you better                                                                                                 

stop eating them as well)                                                                                                                                                                                  

Others are QUITE dangerous for anaphylactic (allergic) people.                                                                                                                                             

Others are moderately dangerous, once more, for everybody, for kids and for                                                                                                                                

allergic people.                                                                                                                                                                                           

Others cause adverse reactions: urticaria, angioedema, asthma.                                                                                                                                             

</P><P>                                                                                                                                                                                                    

Well, here's the list... next time pay a little more attention at those little

<H3>Dangerous Additives</H3></A>    

<BR>

<I><P>There have not been many  studies in the area of 

additives and allergy (and it is easy to guess why, in our awful 

society where only the interests and whims of the big corporations 

are supinely and routinely served and the interests of consumers

are almost NEVER defended, since consumer should -as their name implies- 

"consume" and else shut up :-(<BR>Therefore

 much of the evidence for specific links between substance and reaction is anecdotal. Those

additives that have most often attracted the attention of the few investigators in this field 

can be grouped into about

seven substances or families of substances: dyes, parabens and benzoates, BHA and BHT,

nitrates, aspartame, MSG (monosodium glutamate) and finally, sulfites. This DOES NOT mean, of 

course, that the remaining additives are safe. I repeat: There have been only few 

 studies in the area of 

additives and allergy

<LI>- <B>Sunset Yellow (E110)</B> - a synthetic colourant, which can                     

provoke allergic reactions and hyperactivity; and increased incidence of                 

tumours in animals; banned in Norway.                                                    

                                                                                         

<LI>- <B>Amaranth (E123)</B> - a synthetic colourant, which can provoke                   

asthma, eczema and hyperactivity; it caused birth defects and foetal                     

deaths in some animal tests, possibly also cancer; banned in the USA,                    

Russia and at least 5 other countries.                                                   

                                                                                         

<LI>- <B>Sodium Nitrite (E250)</B> and Potassium Nitrate (E252) -                        

preservatives and colour fixatives, which may provoke hyperactivity and                  

other adverse reactions; potentially carcinogenic; their use is severely                 

restricted in many countries. Nitrates and nitrites

are preservatives that also add colour and flavour, and are common 

in preserved meats such as salami.                                                        

                                                                                         

<LI>- <B>Butylated hydroxanisole BHA (E320) & Butylated hydroxytoluene 

BHT (E321)</B> - synthetic antioxidants, which may                 

trigger hyperactivity and other intolerances; serious concerns over                      

carcinogenicity; BHA is banned in Japan; in 1958 & 1963 official                         

committees of experts recommended that BHT be ban ned in the UK, however                 

due to industry pressure it was not banned; McDonald's eliminated BHT from               

their US products by 1986.  Butylated hydroxanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene 

(BHT) are antioxidants that

appear in many grain and cereal products.<BR>BHA and BHT are known culprits in 

cases of urticaria.                                                        

                                                                                         

<LI>- <B>Carrageenan (E407)</B> - stabiliser and thickening agent; linked                

to toxic hazards, including ulcers and cancer; the most serious concerns                 

relate to degraded carrageenan, which is not a permitted additive.                       

However, native carrageenan, which is us ed, may become degraded in the                  

gut.                                                                                     

                                                                                         

<LI>- <B>Monosodium Glutamate (E621)</B> - "flavour enhancer" - Is an aminoacid 

commonly used as a flavouring. While it appears naturally in some foods like 

Camembert cheese, it's used mainly as an additive, particularly in Chinese 

and Japanese food. A single bowl of Wonton soup can contain 2.5 grams of MSG. 

It's also one of the "secret herbs and spices" in Kentucky Fried Chicken.

<BR>Can                    

cause intolerant reactions and effect chemistry of the brain. <BR>

MSG is responsible for an allergic reaction known as Chinese restaurant syndrome

(CRS), characterized by headache, nausea, chest tightness, sweating and a burning sensation

along the back of the neck. Some researchers writes that these 

symptoms affect "only" "MSG-sensitive" individuals who eat free

MSG (usually added in the restaurant as a condiment) on an empty stomach. you may want to 

apply some easy reversing to such assertions :-)<BR>MSG has also been

blamed in a case of angioedema.                           

                                                                                         

<LI>- <B>Potassium Bromate (E924)</B> - used as flour improver, banned in                 

1989 as a dangerous carcinogen; previously widely used in bread products,                

including McDonald's buns.<P>                                                            

    

<LI> -<B>Aspartame (E951)</B> - (NutraSweet) is another additive that enhances flavour. 

Temporarily banned in the

mid-1970s because of fears that it caused mental retardation and endocrine dysfunction,

aspartame is now back as a common additive in foods and carbonated drinks. <BR>

Aspartame is a known culprit in cases of urticaria.
