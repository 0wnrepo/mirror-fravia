Hello Fravia,



I've been working on a present for you, yes, more lessons for

your pages of reverse engineering. Though they are not about

cracking applications, they involve some "cracking" of sorts.

I appreciate all the work you have put into your site both in

the things you have written and the administration of the

+HCU essays. With no disrespect meant to you, I found a

section of your site that could use a little improvement,

namely the "searching" pages, so I've picked up the gauntlet

to "work well" and have started building a set of "Hunting

Lessons" for your site.



Everyone has his skills, talents and strong set. Considering

your vast reverse engineering skills, your time seems better

spent with real cracking issues rather than searching. I'm

not a cracker of code, well at least not yet, but I can hunt

the net fairly well.



I've kept the pages in line with ideas; small, fast loading

with a few tiny gifs for spice. I don't have the HTML skill

to do them all in edit.com but I'm not using a WYSIWYG

program either. I chose WebEdit Pro (a glorified text editor

with a viewer and HTML reference) so I could actually lean

all the various tags.



There is an irony to contend with here; I see no reason to

waste time writing the lessons unless they are something you

actually want but you'll have no idea if you want them until

you see them. To resolve this I've sent along the rough

drafts of the first three pages. They are unfinished but

should give you an idea of my work and the out line will

show you where things are headed...



...Cheers,



  ->>>--Robin-Hood----></PRE>

<I>And the following part is also EXTREMELY INTERESTING for 

all those among you that never learned the 'repairing' 

techniques needed in order to reconstruct maimed base64 files:</I><PRE>

Lastly the narrow character format is necessary to sucessfully

pass files through the "Cracker" remailers. You will have to

open the message as text and edit the bombs that the remailer

has installed. There are five "Content-" lines repace the

string "=3D3D" and with "=3D" (without the the quotes).



Since the remailer will alter the exaples above, I'll put 

them in text; search for "equals three capital-D" and replace 

with just the "equals" character, no spaces or quotes. There 

should be two equal signs at the end of the "Content-MD5" line.



Also search for <FONT color=blue>line bombs</FONT>, they are really simple to find

and repair. Search for "=3D" (the "equal" char) in the main

body of the encoded message. If you find one it will be

followed by two numbers which represent the hex value for

the character that belongs in that position. Replace the

equal sign and the numbers with the corresponding letter and

look for a second equal sign after (at the end of the line)

and delete it. The remailer tends to go after "F" Hex46 for

some reason so you'll probably find an "equals"46 at the

start of a few lines. Replace them with F and delete the

second equals sign at the end of the line. We're not supposed

to be able to pass any files through this remailer, that's the 

purpose of all this maiming, but every thing is crackable even 

the "Georgia Cracker."</PRE>

<I>Here you have some examples:</I><PRE>

Remailers seem to maim files choosing a letter randomly, every time the 

encoded file has a line starting with that letter, it will be maimed.

Dear Robin Hood, it seems that at least some sections of my site begin to 

bear those fruits +ORC spoke about long ago. After the Student section, 

which has blossomed beyond any possible forecast, there are now a whole 

series of sections slowly 'taking off', or at least so I hope enduring the 

frozen rains of this 

still cold winter. Some contributions are just little snippets of 

knowledge, others, like yours, are more structured and promising.<BR>

<BR><BR>

You write that my time

<FONT color=purple>"seems better

spent with real cracking issues rather than searching"</FONT>, and I would 

happily agree IF there were somebody else teaching searching matters, which 

is not the case, at least not until now. The simple truth is that all these 

activities are REALLY interrelated: cracking, searching, reversing, hacking and, 

in my opinion, understanding the real face of the reality as well. That's the 

reason I'm seriously keen, now, in developing and pushing also 

my '<A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">reality cracking</A>' section (I hope with even more 

help from +ORC and others): I 

believe that our ultimate goal must be to grow,  out of a masse of gullible beginners, 

not only 'simple' crackers, but clever, 'ethycally' good and mighty 

powerful <U>reversing wizards</U>. We'll need their unvaluable help if 

we ever hope to reverse this world... reverse! Not only in order to understand its awful 

realities, taking profit of this, through our knowledges, for ourselves, which is a 

very easy thing to do, 

but also in order 

to change it, which is incredibly difficult, given the power available to those

 that DO NOT WANT any changement. 

"Crackers haben bis jetzt das Welt nur verschieden Interpretiert, 

es kommt aber darauf an es zu ver”ndern".<BR><BR>

I hope you'll "work well", as I assume +ORC must have written to you, and that 

you'll send your complete lessons.<BR><BR>

Two comments, about form and about content:<BR><B>1) FORM</B><BR> I respected your colors choices, yet, as a 

suggestion, I would advice you to choose black fonts 

on gray backgrounds for reading and printing 'obvious) reasons. Some Sherwood green 

can be kept using the simple table tricks I have used at the top of this very page.

<BR><B>2) CONTENT</B><BR>

A caveat: The Minnesota teacher<BR>

Searching is indeed difficult and my friend Robin Hood has been, in this case, trapped 

inside a false path.<BR>

The Minnesota teacher in Robin's lesson ONE is a very real chap (altough I agree that 

such a biography 

could be useful to set up a fake page). He only happen to have got the same SLOT in 

Geocities where a page of mine has been hosted for almost one year (until Geocities 

censored it, that is :-(<BR>

At the beginning the poor chap has been buried by hundred of emails from people seeking 

my page, and he was so kind to have a link to my new sites, link that he has now, apparently, 

taken away. These are the vagaries of Geocities and all other free pages providers: 

you never know if the slot you find was 

a famous craker location before (or worse :-)<BR>Robin, you could have avoided this mistake 

performing a SEARCH on my pages for that URL (since you were searching for fravia)... 

and you would in that case have found exactly 

the same alta vista trick that you explain, with that very example you use, 

on my own searengi.htm page (I have 

always been too lazy to change it). So even expert searchers can be fooled, as it seems :-)<BR>

Yet this does not diminish the importance of the lesson by Robin, in fact the 'mapping/brute boting' 

trick is one of the methods I use myself 

to dump complete maps of the smut sites I want to destroy :-)<BR>And since my knowledges in this

field are far from good, I'm eagerly awaiting Robin's lessons on this matter!



<BR><BR>

Two more answers:<BR>- The anonymizer 'real' trick is well know by those who need to know it 

and it is indeed NOT a good idea to go public with it. So don't speak about it in your 

next lessons.

<BR>- Yes it's a decoy; yes you have been fooled (at least I hope); No, I have nothing to do 

with MJ13 and my handle (at least in this phase) is fravia+ or fravia or Fravia
