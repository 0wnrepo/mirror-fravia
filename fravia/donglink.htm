<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0">Here is a list of dongle protected softwares (over

40) I found during a quick search through the most usual Search Engines.

They ALL can be freely downloaded from their companies home pages.&nbsp;

<BR><B><FONT SIZE=+1>IMPORTANT</FONT></B>:&nbsp;

<BR>Note that I DON'T know most of the following program or&nbsp; their

protection level (except those I cracked and did not included in my essay

or are from the same company). Some of them are probably very easy (may

I say bloody stupid?) to crack, other may be stronger or un-crackable so

don't blame me if you crash your PC and get bursted out of this planet

while attempting to run them without the dongle!&nbsp;

<BR>Before downloading them, browse through their companies home page and

ensure that you will not download just an update patch that will not run

if you don't have a&nbsp; previous full version of the soft (most of them

are described as fully functional versions). As you'll see, some of them

will work in Demo mode if you don't have the dongle, or will simply refuse

to run.&nbsp; Take care, you may have to download huge files (5Mb, 10Mb

or more).&nbsp;

<BR>Last words: some of those softs may NOT included the dongle driver

(specially if they use Sentinel / Hasp or DesKey dongles) but you'll just

have to visit the manufacturer WWW site and download the latest drivers

(that's free).&nbsp;

<BR>Good luck...&nbsp;
