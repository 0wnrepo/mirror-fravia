I'm not much one for contributing essays, but this has got to be the

stupidest protection scheme I have ever come across. I cracked this program at

work in under 3 minutes, breaking my previous record with QuickViewPlus 4.0 ( a

5 or so minute BMSG approach done while on the phone...very expedient ;),

and was so shocked by the poor programming in terms of security and in general

that I had to stop using the program. I passed it on to another aspiring

cracker and told him to crack it without w32dasm or Soft-Ice as an exercise... </PRE><I><CENTER>

And this essay contains indeed an important lesson for all shareware 

programmers: try at least not to be OBVIOUS... what's the point of a protection 

scheme so weak that you don't even need to dead list it (let alone winice it) to 

crack it in 2 minutes flat? I know, I know... these &quot;programmers&quot; are not &quot;real&quot; 

programmers... they just assemble toy applications after having read &quot;Teach yourself 

Visual Basic for Windows 95 in 21 days&quot; or some other crap like that... yet, c'mon, 

dear protectionist reader... if you have made it until this page you should know better how to protect a program 

(and how to deprotect it if needs be :-)

Target: EnTray Version 1.3, by Ashkay R 

EXE Size: 48.5 K 

Zip File: 661.8 K 

Distribution: Tucows (<A href="tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#182" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#182">http://207.155.78.240/files/entray13.zip</A>) 

 

The protection scheme used on this software was so simple to defeat that I 

am embarassed to even be writing about it; in fact it has so diminished my

respect for the programmer that I cannot bring myself to even use the 

software anymore.  

And what software is this? 

 

It is EnTray, a program which, like TrayIcon, allows you to put any

shortcut you like (for example, the Soft-Ice Symbol Loader or BaseCalc) on 

your TaskBar. 

It is shareware, and very easy to use... even easier to configure than 

TrayIcon. The program is 48.5 K and comes with a 987K .dll file (mfc42.dll, 

hmmm, what could this have been written using-- Delphi? Pascal? No wait, I'll 

get it, hold on...) -- as far as I'm concerned, yet another reason to use 

&quot;static&quot; instead of &quot;shared&quot; libraries when compiling MFC (or any C++/VB) 

applications. There is no reason a program with a max size of maybe 100K 

should be distributed with over 1 MB of binary files. 

 

Every detail of an application is a clue as to how to crack it. I took the

marriage of a 987K .dll with a 49K .exe to indicate that I would need neither

Soft-Ice nor W32DASM. 

The biggest lesson to be gained from EnTray is to never make things more  

complicated than they need be. 

 

<B>Stage 1: Information gathering</B> 

 

EnTray comes with numerous help files in HTML format (another sign...); 

I only bothered to unzip REGN.HTM, in which the author states: 

  <FONT color="purple">

&quot;On receipt of your registration request, I will send you a registration 

program which you will need to run in order to register EnTray to your name. 

The registered version differs from the downloadable version in only two

respects : 

  The About Box does not appear on starting up EnTray and EnTray silently 

  installs itself; 

  The About Box (when you choose to bring it up) acknowledges that your 

  copy of EnTray is licensed to you.&quot;

  					 </FONT>

When you run Entray, a small nag screen pops up telling you that the

software is UNREGISTERED. The first thing that comes to mind is to kill the 

nag screen with a resource editor; but BRW gives an &quot;Unknown File Format&quot; 

error, and Symantec Resource Studio gives an &quot;Invalid Bitmap Header&quot; error--

probably due to calls in the MFC .dll. 

Next step: right-click on EnTray.exe and choose QuickView, scroll down to

the Imports Section. Hmmm, MFC, MSVCRT (MS Visual C++ Runtime Library), Kernel, 

User, GDI, and...  ah, ADVAPI32.DLL, infamous for its registry access calls. 

Sure enough, EnTray imports <FONT color="blue">

RegCreateKeyExA, 

RegSetValueExA, 

RegQueryValueExA, and 

RegOpenKeyExA.</FONT> 

Door #1 is therefore the 95 Registry. 

 

<B>Stage 2: Runtime Monitoring</B> 

 

The best thing to do when a program accesses the Registry is, of course, 

to run  RegMon, which gives us the following output: 

<FONT color="purple"> 

30435 OpenKey      LOCAL\Software\Akshay\Entray\1.0      SUCCESS 

30436 QueryValueEx LOCAL\Software\Akshay\Entray\1.0\REG  NOT FOUND 

</FONT> 

This seems fairly straightforward: EnTray is looking for a value named

&quot;REG&quot; in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Akshay\Entray\1.0, and as the 

program is not registered it is not finding it. 

So using RegEdit, create a string value in the above key, name 

it REG and give it a value of 1 for &quot;True&quot;. 

 

Restart EnTray...Bingo! No nag screen. Your product is now registered. 

 

<B>Stage 3: Disgust</B> 

 

Granted, this pretty weak protection scheme is for a program that was 

probably written more for personal use that for commercial distribution; 

I can accept that.  

But, the one criticism I will offer before deleting the program from my

system: try at least to be less than obvious...if nothing else, DO NOT call 

the &quot;magic registry key&quot; <FONT color="blue">REG</FONT> -- call it MRU or WindowPos, or HCU, and put it 

in HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG/Display/Settings or any other key that the system accesses 

frequently; the HKLM/Software key added by your program should only contain 

settings regarding user preferences and file locations, <U>not</U> the key to 

your whole protection scheme.
