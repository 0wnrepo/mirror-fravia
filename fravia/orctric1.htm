<I>Well, +ORC received MrWho essay and this must have 

interested him so much, that he immediately sent me the following short 

essay, that I'm of course glad to publish as well</I></CENTER><HR size=6>

<PRE>

fravia,

hope you'll get some more essays on what you call 'reality cracking' on your 

most beautiful site, here are some short notes of mine, I'll prepare something 

better as soon as I have more time. 



<FONT size=+2>CIGARETTES</FONT>



As anybody with a couple of eyes and a still working brain can easily notice, 

few things are more reality aliens that cigarettes commercials... 

I mean: all advertisement and commercials that you are bombarded with are

of course totally reality alien, but cigarettes commercials beat the rest of 

the lot in spades. 

Since the fags-producers are on (a well deserved) defensive, their generously 

founded self-promoting propaganda is particularly 'pushed' and their patterns 

are obvious: a good starting point for anyone interested in advertisement 

cracking. 

To study those patterns you should of course take notice of the various 

local 'geographical' situations:



<B>In the States and states conquered countries</B>:

There you have solitary cow-boys in the dusk, real men smoking a 

well-deserved fag before eating (uncomfortably) with other real men 

(no no women there, it's a macho-homo world). Big, strong, "free" men, 

the kind of guys that will not even discuss with you the possibility of 

non-smoking, their freedom expressed in the resolute, strong characters 

that do 'smoke' puffing freedom inside and outside their lungs (slumping 

beans and farting as well, but this you wont see nor hear :=)

So the calm lone smoker (<I>beata solitudo</I>) is here the Ipertraditional 

American pioneer and "freedom fighter", d'you really want to steal 

or, worse "regulate" his freedom away? Are you against freedom and 

American values or what?



<B>In Germany and German conquered countries</B>:

There you have smiling 'intello' guys, nice honest eyes, look: they do 

not 'renounce' to their 'right' to smoke. A real strong character 

<I>mussen solche kluge raucher haben</I>. Nice, clever, leftist types, 

that will not bow their heads to 'organized' illiberal trends. Nice 

looking, clever (they have spectacles, therefore they must be clever :=), 

socially integrated girls, too, that defend their right <I>frei zu sein</I> 

against 'conventional' no-smoking attitudes. Same lies than 

above, of course but here the fag-smokers and maggot lovers are not 

macho guys roaming ALONE in the countryside, taming horses and sleeping 

in the desert (there is not much countryside left in Europe nowadays 

and macho is considered 'poor class'), the happy smokers are here 

"social" fellows, always together 'with other people' a bunch of merrily 

puffing, socializing, good-looking, nice fellows that just happen to 

smoke... well, so what? Is it not an upright right they have? Are you 

against freedom of choice, against our <U>tolerant</U> european style 

of life, or what?



<B>In the new slave easteuropean countries</B>

Here there is no need for well-bred polite tricks: people have not 

developed any anti-advertisement defenses at all, they lived fifty 

years almost without the blessings of an all-present advertisement, 

to fool them into buying something useless (and plain nocive in this 

case) it's as easy as stealing bonbons from babies... fag-makers just 

use for such "easy ones" the good old plain tricks. See my boy: airplane 

pilots smoke, so you better smoke too if ou want to fly planes and 

have a nice travelling job (remember the old Rothmans fags advertisement 

in Europe, long ago? I do: A plane-pilot sleeve holding the Rothman 

fag box: blue and white and <U>very</U> BOAC). So it's easy: <I>beati possidentes</I>:

rich guys smoke, wanna be rich? Just need a bit of smoke into your lungs.

Western-type blokes, handsome, blonde-hair, 1.90 meter high, smoke like 

chimneys... so you better smoke too, exspecially if you want to forget 

your waiting in the rain at 4:00 am; soaked to the bones, awaiting an old 

bus for your morning trip to the stinky plastic toys fabric, where you'll 

work 10 hours to fetch your 15 dollars, to buy some good fags. 

You better smoke believe us, may be at the end of the process you'll get 

no cancer at all but a nice swimming pool instead. 



<B>In the slave Asian countries</B>

Same as above, but with a distinguished oriental 'taste'. Of course you 

don't even need to 'tell' those people to smoke, they do it automatically, 

have been conditioned this way from the beginning, and anyway they enjoy 

so much pollution in their cities at the moment that smoking wont really 

damage them all too much. So they really believe that smoking is in... 

so here the fag-producers and fag-sellers can concentrate more and more 

on how to conquer the small remaining untouched groups, like very young girls, 

very young boys, non working women, etceteras.



<B>Talk shows = puffing shows</B>

Limiting this first general examination of the advertisement ads 

themselves, you may take notice that in the countries where the

fags-advertisement have been (or will be) forbidden, the TV-serials have 

had an incredible increase of people smoking... and I mean "nice" 

looking people smoking. 

Hope you don't believe this is casual: NOTHING is casual in this awful 

society we are compelled to live in. This increase in 'smoking people' 

is a "countermeasure" that the fag-producers have started. It is of 

course very easy to crack . 

As you may imagine, there is absolutely no need at all, in a 15 minutes 

short typical talk show to smoke whatsoever, besides those idiots are 

so painted with the various 'telegenic' make up and powders, that any 

lip-contact, like smoking, risks to leave stains. 

Yet, despite this lack of any real smoking need, in those same 15 minutes 

you'll see increasingly more and more participants puffing the hell 

out of their fags... and this is also more and more the behavior of 

those obscene and completely fake "spectators" that sit behind, like 

nodding and listening zombies, during the talk.

This bogus message should represent for all slave-watchers a 'normal' 

and 'nice' ambiance... nobody should think that smoking is 'out' or 

reserved only to poor people and outcasts (as it <I>de facto</I> happens

to be nowadays).



<B>The Camel river crossing</B>

So, ok, there you are, free and alone on your nice open Landrover (the 

'short' version, note), somewhere on an isolated river crossing somewhere 

in Bongoland, puffing your fag. It's a sunny day and you have nothing to 

do (besides crossing the river). You're a man (of course) and you have 

a nice 'Indiana Jones' look (he smoke too, btw). 

Note also how all cigarettes in the ads are either UNSMOKED (you see 

the virgin packets with some fags already sorted out, ready to be 

taken) or AT THE VERY BEGINNING (the magic dusk moment of the "light 

one on"). As it seems they don't like to show ash-trades full of 

nicotine-soaked maggots, do they... as a matter of fact, came to 

think of it, they don't show ash-trades at all...  where do all those 

people turn their maggots off? Does the Marlboro cow-boy leave a 

snail trail of maggots all over Arizona?



Ok, ok, it's your sunny day on the river crossing, of course.

So you are not inside a stinking closed car inside a stinking queue of 

similar stinking useless cars, with your car-ash trade filled with maggots, 

with noisy clacksons all around you and a long day work before (or behind) 

you. So you are not sitting all day in your living room watching awful 

'morning slaves' TV-broadcasting because you don't know what to do with 

your day and yourself and you have no work at all. So you are not a young

student without perspectives (else than conforming and buying gadgets) 

whatsoever, without any hope to change a society that you KNOW should

not maim people's brains. So you smoke on your nice jeep. And then you  

throw your maggot in the river.
