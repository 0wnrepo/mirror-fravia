<BR>

 I'm glad to publish here a second essay by Tapu (see also <A href="tapu1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tapu1.htm">tapu1.htm</A>: 

Tapu's <I>Cracking The Information Curtain</I>, written in October 1998), on the "oncoming thirld world war".<BR>

Read and enjoy!

 The below is terribly disjointed, but you already

 said all of the cogent,

 cohesive stuff in your <A href="natoagr1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/natoagr1.htm">NATO essay</A>, and it's a

 disjointed war, anyway.

  <BR><BR>

 It sure was sweet of Russia to save the Known World

 the other day, I think

 I'll send them a nice card, maybe some fruit.

  <BR><BR>

 ====================================================

 <H3>Cracking The  World War III Show:  A War Without

 Good Guys.</H3>

  <BR><BR>

 A "terrorist" is a person with whose politics the

 speaker or sponsoring

 organization disagrees.

 A "freedom fighter" or "patriot" is a person with

 whose politics the

 speaker or sponsoring organization agrees. 

  <BR><BR>

 Thus, to Milosovich, both NATO and the KLA are

 "terrorists," while NATO

 supporters consider both the Serb army and "Arkan's

 Tigers" to be

 "terrorists."

  <BR><BR>

 On occasion, some Yugoslav officials have referred

 to the vast sea of

 fleeing old ladies and toddlers as "terrorists,"

 while some opposition

 party politicos in the US agree with Milosovich that

 the KLA are "terrorists."

  <BR><BR>

 I have deliberately avoided any qualifiers about the

 actions of any of the

 above-mentioned groups, since that is irrelevant to

 the orthodoxy of

 Briefing Room terrorist designation.

  <BR><BR>

 Serb police who beat up Kosovars are "brutal thugs,"

 Macedonian police who

 beat up Kosovars are "suffering under the strain of

 the influx of refugees

 that threaten to upset its ethnic balance."

  <BR><BR>

 Milosovich's preference that ethnic Albanians live

 somewhere other than

 Serbia, and his efforts to achieve it, are "ethnic

 cleansing."  Macedonia's

 preference that ethnic Albanians live somewhere

 other than Macedonia, and

 their efforts to achieve it, are - you got it

 "suffering under the strain

 of the influx of refugees that threaten to upset its

 ethnic balance."

 

  <BR><BR>

 

 Any civilians killed by Yugoslav forces are de facto

 victims of a

 "massacre," a "crime against humanity," or if it's

 more than 10 or so,

 "genocide."

 If NATO bombs blow apart civilians, including women

 and children, British

 newspapers scream "I FORGIVE YOU, NATO" in

 near-second coming type, echoing

 the astonishing Mr Shea's version of the reaction of

 a Kosovar matron,

 swathed in bandages, on learning that her entire

 family had been blown to

 bits by a NATO bomb. Of course there is no way to

 verify Mr. Shea's

 anecdote, which would have to be second-hand at

 best,  since he has not

 actually been to the "theatre of operations."

  <BR><BR>

 And "theatre" is exactly what the Serb media says it

 is, asserting that the

 refugees are in fact paid actors.

 But to be fair, they only said this after the US

 said that they bombed the

 Chinese embassy because their map was old, (The

 Chinese embassy in Belgrade

 has been in its present location since 1994, and is

 clearly marked on

 tourist maps of Belgrade, available at newsstands

 worldwide, for about $4 US).

  <BR><BR>

 Understandably, Serbia does not want to make itself

 vulnerable to charges

 that it is losing the Absurd Press Release War.

  <BR><BR>

 One US congresstron, who had obviously done his

 homework in the area of

 Belgrade map pricing,  blamed the Chinese embassy

 bombing on intelligence

 underfunding in the US. With a budget of only $29

 million a year, he said,

 of course they could not buy a new map. 

  <BR><BR>

 Chinese anger at the bombing was quickly

 characterized by more than one

 Washington voice as "manipulative" and "using the

 situation to try to gain

 trade advantages."

  <BR><BR>

 Last summer, when 2 US embassies were bombed, the US

 reacted by bombing a

 medicine factory in the Sudan, and an empty camp in

 Afghanistan, killing

 only a few Pakistani night watchmen in the Afghani

 camp.

 Neither the Sudanese nor the Afghani military

 participated in the bombing

 of either US embassy.

  <BR><BR>

 

 Fravia is correct when he points out that the

 majority of this war's

 victims are the very young, very old, and weakest of

 the civilian

 population, throughout Yugoslavia.

  <BR><BR>

 After 6 weeks of war, it is hard to find a single

 civilian in Yugoslavia

 who is not suffering in some way as a result of NATO

 bombing. It is quite

 easy to find Serb politicians and soldiers who are

 not suffering at all.

  <BR><BR>

 Blowing up all the bridges on the  Danube, rendering

 it almost innavigable,

  has done more damage to European merchants outside

 Yugoslavia than it has

 to the Serb army, and the ecological damage to the

 entire eastern half of

 the continent may not be fully realized for years.

  <BR><BR>

 On the other hand, by the Pentagon Bow-Tie King

 Bacon's own admission, the

 "campaign" has "not prevented a single act of

 brutality" to a Kosovo Albanian.

 

  <BR><BR>

 Many refugees say that Serbs drove them from their

 homes. Some admit that

 they fled their homes because of NATO bombing,

 others cite ground battles

 between Serb and KLA forces. Many say that they

 support the air strikes,

 want them to continue, and that they want NATO to

 send ground troops.

  <BR><BR>

 But not one, so far, has said "I was in  danger, and

 NATO  saved me."

  <BR><BR>

 By the closest to reliable sources that we can get,

 and those are

 admittedly few and far between, the consensus seems

 to be  that the bulk of

 the atrocities, while they may indeed be sanctioned

 by Belgrade, are in

 fact carried out by what in the US would be called

 "gangs."

  <BR><BR>

 Few military strategists, of any nationality or

 allegiance have expressed

 confidence that destroying Serb TV or a bridge in

 Novi Sad has a rat's

 chance in hell of acting as an effective deterrent

 to some punk in a

 village in Kosovo who is ripping earrings out of the

 ears of someone's

 great-grandmother, or snipping off the  fingers of 6

 year olds.

  <BR><BR>

 A few lonely voices have dared to ask why then, if

 NATO feels so strongly

 about this, do they not simply put a stop to it?

 Surely no one is

 suggesting that the combined military forces of the

 United states and 18

 European countries are no match for a handful of

 street bullies?

  <BR><BR>

 If Milosovich is indeed the driving power, the

 mastermind of these

 atrocities, why is NATO's fury seemingly directed at

 so many schools and

 hospitals while Milosovich enjoys greater and more

 loyal support form

 Yugoslav citizens than he ever dreamed possible?

  <BR><BR>

 Answers to these questions, if there are answers at

 all, are known to few

 if any beyond the hushed corridors of State of the

 various NATO nations.

  <BR><BR>

 It must be noted, however, that the occasional

 troublemaker has pointed out

 that while Americans may feel for the raped 13 year

 old, the eye-gouged

 grandmother, the endless parade of Kosovar suffering

 that has (at least

 until it was upstaged by the Chinese guest star

 appearance) dominated each

 episode of the World War III Show, when all is said

 and done, few Americans

 are willing to bury their own relatives in the name

 of saving someone

 else's little sister.

  <BR><BR>

 Sending in ground troops would be, to put it simply,

  too dangerous. This

 is not our grandfather's World War.

  <BR><BR>

 So why not just get rid of Milosovich? In any major

 urban area in the US,

 there are any number of people who will be able and

 willing, and for a very

 reasonable fee, to deliver him, and Arkan, too, to

 the border, alive,

 unharmed, and all dressed up for their trip to the

 Hague.

  <BR><BR>

 This opens an even more unpleasant can of worms.

 US officials themselves admit that if Milosovich

 were a war criminal, how

 would it look for the US to negotiate with him? And

 they do want the option

 of negotiating with him. After all, he just might

 control a good chunk of

 Europe before too long...
