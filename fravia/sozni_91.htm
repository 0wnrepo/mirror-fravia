<H2>The Art of Guessing</H2></CENTER>

<P>There are many ways to get registered software.&nbsp; You can buy it, you can get a

copy from a friend or from the internet, you can crack a demo, you can use a serial

number, etc.&nbsp; There are so many ways that if you really want something, you can get

it.</P>

<P><BR>

I have noticed that many ActiveX controls are updated frequently.&nbsp; For example,

DataDynamics has been posting a new update for ActiveReports every two weeks.&nbsp; If you

get a pirated copy or a patch, then you never really have the most recent version.

&nbsp; That's why I prefer licensing my software.&nbsp; And that's what my essays are

about: licensing, not cracking software.<BR>

<BR>

I have already talked about a couple of ways to get licensed.&nbsp; There is another way

that I am starting to use more and more.&nbsp; That is to hack the company's web site.

There are may ways to find info on the company's website.&nbsp; Here are some methods that

I use:<BR>

<BR>

-&nbsp; Browse their FTP site looking for hidden directories<BR>

-&nbsp; Browse their FTP site looking for stuff out in the open that they have forgotten

about<BR>

-&nbsp; Use a FrontPage attack (there are many)<BR>

-&nbsp; Exploit weaknesses in Active Server Pages<BR>

-&nbsp; View the source of pages (especially registering and purchasing online pages)<BR>

-&nbsp; And my favorite:&nbsp; Guessing<BR>

<BR>

I can't believe how many sites I have hacked just by guessing stuff.&nbsp; As I mentioned

before I got all of the Winternals Software just by guessing the URL's.&nbsp; I got a

password for a protoview install by typing random keys (I heard someone else had done the

same thing).&nbsp; I have found serial number lists, serial number generators and

validators, and user registrations.<BR>

<BR>

It's all there for the taking.&nbsp; The trick is to be really good at guessing.&nbsp; The

principle here is that people are predictable.&nbsp; If someone thinks a certain way one

day, most likely they are going to think the same way the next day.&nbsp; Also, people are

usually going to name things with the first thing that comes to mind. <BR>

<BR>

For example, if you wanted to created a directory for downloads, what would you call that

directory?&nbsp; And then if you have one directory for demos, what would you call the

directory for retail products?<BR>

<BR>

Do see my point?&nbsp; The Amazing Kreskin works on this principle.&nbsp; He asks people

to think of a vegetable and most people will think of a carrot.&nbsp; He asks them to

think of a shape then to think of another shape inside that shape and most of the time he

knows what they are thinking.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Because people are predictable.<BR>

<BR>

How many new computer users do you think use their logon as their password?&nbsp; Many.

&nbsp; And why do you think there are so many common password lists on hacking sites?

&nbsp; Because a lot of people use these common passwords.&nbsp; See? They are

predictable.<BR>

<BR>

Now if a company has a product named ERD Commander and the information about that product

is on a page called erdcmndr.htm and the demo is named<BR>

erdcmndr.exe in the demos directory then what do you think the real product is going to be

called?&nbsp; Yep, erdcmndr.exe (in a different directory, of course).&nbsp; <BR>

<BR>

To get the real version of ERD Commander I looked at the demo at www.sysinternals.com then

went to their retail site, <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.winternals.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.winternals.com/'" tppabs="http://www.winternals.com/">www.winternals.com</A> and

downloaded erdcmdr.exe.&nbsp; Of course, I first had to find the download directory, but

that's another story.<BR>

<BR>

And guess what? I just repeated that same process for all of their products.

&nbsp; Remember what I said?&nbsp; If someone thinks a certain way one day, most likely

they are going to think the same way the next day. People are predictable.<BR>

<BR>

Here's another one:&nbsp; Suppose a company has a wep page that allows you to register

their software online.&nbsp; It is called regonline.htm.&nbsp; And let's suppose they are

using IIS on Windows NT.&nbsp; And let's suppose they want all these online registrations

to be saved to a text file.&nbsp; What would that file be named and where would it be

located?&nbsp; These would be my first guesses for www.company.com/regonline.htm:<BR>

<BR>

www.company.com/regonline.txt<BR>

www.company.com/_private/regonline.txt<BR>

www.company.com/_vti_pvt/regonline.txt<BR>

<BR>

Here's another one, Janus Systems has a page to register online in the

http://www.janusys.com/Support/ directory.&nbsp; These registrations post to a<BR>

text file.&nbsp; Now if your customers were registering their software and these

registrations post to a text file and your company is in Mexico,<BR>

what would you call this text file?<BR>

<BR>

My guesses would be:<BR>

www.janusys.com/support/registration.txt<BR>

www.janusys.com/support/register.txt<BR>

www.janusys.com/support/registracion.txt<BR>

www.janusys.com/support/registra.txt<BR>

<BR>

And you know what? It's the last one (at least it used to be before I first posted this

essay on my mailing list)<BR>

<BR>

The key to guessing is research.&nbsp; Look around at their website and see what they name

things and where they put things.&nbsp; Look at pictures and links and downloads.&nbsp; Do

they like cryptic abbreviations? Is there a method that uses the product version number?

&nbsp; Do you see patterns?<BR>

<BR>

Then, just guess.&nbsp; You would be surprised how many times this works.&nbsp; That is,

if you have really mastered the art of guessing.<BR>
