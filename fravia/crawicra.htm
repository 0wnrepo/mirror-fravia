A crack without craking: Talonsoft's Operational Art of War

<BR><BR></H3></CENTER>

This excellent strategic game (out in October 1998) has been published / will be published as 

"demo" version on many world magazines' CD-ROM covers in late fall/winter 1998. 

My copy is a Cdcover Demo without version number, with a length of 936.448 bytes 

dated 30/06/98.<BR>

If you can't find a magazine with this demo just fetch it for instance from here...<BR>

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/'" tppabs="http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/">http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/</A><BR><BR>

This demo  

<U>should</U> allow you to play only one of the main campaigns: The Corea war. You <U>should not</U> 

be allowed to resume saved games. You <U>should not</U> be able to use the scenario editor.



<BR><BR>Yet, as you will see, you will be able to use this "demo"</UL>

<LI>To play IMMEDIATELY most scenarios</LI>

<LI>To play -with little work- ALL scenarios</LI>

<LI>To save and play saved games</LI>

<LI>To edit and prepare new scenarios with the games' editor</LI>

</UL>

In fact you'll transform this demo in a FULL-FLEDGED (good) strategical game...<BR><BR>

Believe me: all options and routines are there, you'll just have to individuate them, 'lock them' 

and reverse them... and 

the funny part is that in order to play most scenarios you don't even need to 'CRACK' 

this demo at all... 

it comes with all the necessary code already installed on YOUR own harddisk. It's a 'crack without cracking', 

great reversing fun! BTW, I may actually even buy the commercial release, because it is a really good strategical game and because I like to have and read the manuals of the games I really play...<BR>

<BR><BR>

There is, as I said, a 'compulsory demo file' 

which is called <FONT color=blue>Korea 50-51.SCE</FONT>, and you'll find it inside the 

\TOAWdemo\scenarios subdirectory on your own harddisk once you have installed the demo. But, remarkably, you will find there something else as well...<BR>



Ok, I'm sure you already guessed it all (eh eh) once again a demo comes with (almost) 

the COMPLETE version concealed inside... lazy protectors didn't want to spend a little time 

preparing a real demo... they just crippled a complete version and hammered it into a

crippled demo... therefore let's have a look at our own harddisk once we have installed... what is this? <FONT color=purple>

Yeah: incredible yet true: all 

the other scenarii of this nice game are already there, inside 

the 'demo' version, loaded on your own harddisk. (Admittedly, some of these 

won't have -yet- all the necessary graphics... yet most of them will work 

fine with very little 'finetuning'...<BR><BR>

Fun isn't it? Of course you may crack the simple protection scheme of 

this demo (see below) in order to play "as you should" i.e. 

as if you had the full release, but the object of 

this small introduction is not "how to crack" this target, but rather how to get 

full functionality from  

this target WITHOUT ANY NEED TO CRACK IT, see: you actually don't need any 

reverse engineering knowledge (just elementary dos rename commands lore): Pace 

yourself and believe me: In order to play <U>any</U> campaign of this supposedly 

"limited" demo (or any of the zillion scenarios you can download from the web, for that matter), just 

rename the campaign you want to play to "<FONT color=red>Korea 50-51.SCE</FONT>". Choose your 'Korea' Demo Option and then 

play whatever you want...<BR><BR>

All images are in plain *.bmp format, so you 

can modify them at leasure, which, as you will see, is quite important in order to restore the full functionality of this demo. 

The A.I. -as I said- is not bad at all and if you're a strategic buff (like 

me :-) you'll have MONTHS of interesting play with this 'demo'!

<BR><BR>

Why did the Talonsoft guys actually leave all the scenarios inside a supposedly "limited"  demo 

beats me. There is a famous precedent, 

that has made HISTORY when performed by Mindscape with 

Panzer General (back in 1996), and all demo-releasers -at least the many perusing 

my site- were supposed by now to be immune to this kind of blunders... but 

as we have already seen a couple of months ago with Gettysburg (see the very good instructions by +Rezident in 

order to turn Sid Meier's demo into a full-fledged release) this kind of 'mistake' is indeed still quite 

common. I wonder if I just find them in the strategic oriented games only because these are 

almost the only games I really have a look at... in fact I wonder if this kind of blunder 

is actually also very common in all other 'limited functionality' (i.e. 'crippled') applications and games that are continuously released? Who knows... 

the point is: often enough you don't need actually to 'crack' anything in order to transform a 

demo release into a full-fledged software... may be this is intentional...? :-)

<HR>

Anyway this raises an interesting 'legal' question: let's for a moment admit that the 

publishing of an elegant cracking solution for a protection scheme would really damage 

the 'material interests' of a software producer... as all my readers know I don't reckon this 

to be true at all, since I believe that all warez sites, where you can find any software 

COMPLETE AND ALREADY REGGED and all 'SERIAL' sites or lists, where you can find 

zillions of stolen serials and 

keygenerators, damage those same interests in a 'really tangible' way... anyway, let's concede, for the sake of 

this discussion, that the knowledge given out on 'teaching' sites like mine could, 

if used with malicious purposes, damage those same interests... (note that this is also true for 

all sites that teach programming basics and assembly, in fact for all 'teaching' sites  :-) OK, nuff caveats: 

now, even if that were true, the big question is: 

what about programmers (like Talonsoft here) stuffing your harddidsk with complete sections of their software you 

are not supposed to use? (You'r not even supposed to 'know' that you have those files on your harddisk). Who's cheating who in these cases? 

An interesting line of thoughts IMO. And I wonder if all demo-releasers reading this will 

ever thank us...

<BR><HR>

<H3>A LITTLE REVERSING CANNOT DAMAGE US</H3><BR>

Now to the more reversing oriented part of this small essay: As you'll see 

we need a little reversing in order to understand some finer points...

<HR WIDTH=100% SIZE=2>

As you can see the 'protection' was a simple strstr function on an hardcoded 

scenario name. That's the reason you could play just changing it: 

since any 

wrong name would give a zero, you would jump correctly only if the scenario 

name you'r searching (at 5EDD20) matches the hardcoded one (or if you 

change the scenario names, or if you just load 1 into eax, for instance 

changing the 

<FONT color=blue><U>test eax, eax</U></FONT> into an <FONT color=blue><U>inc eax</U></FONT>), 

or if you choose a more complete patching solution, for instance bypassing completely this 

strstr check and landing directly onto the 'go ahead nice guy' part of the code... there are 

infinite possibilities... once you understand the code.

<BR><HR><H3>GOSTH UNITS?</H3>

Ok, now everybody that will play with this stuff will soon find an apparent flaw... I hear 

you all already asking... "Hey fravia+... how comes that even if I now 

can play all scenarios, I can see on the screen only PART of the colored 

tiles?"; "Man this is not funny: gosth units?"; "Hey, frav, is 

it an ugly anti-cracking protection scheme?"; "Woah! Did we trigger a remote 

CRC protection somewhere?"<BR>



No, friends, I wish it were so (and it would have proved quite an effective 

anticracking trick, btw, take note, protectors! :-)<BR>Yet in this case is 

nothing of relevance and we'll soon solve this little problem: 

have a look inside your target (that's always a <U>good</U> 

practice). You should routinely check what's inside your targets... 

download the good (old dos) 'strings' program from 

my <A href="tools.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tools.htm">tools.htm</A> page) and you'll see, using the command<BR>

<CENTER><FONT color=red>strings -o -6 opart_md.exe</FONT></CENTER><BR> 

that your target is calling a LOT of graphic files!

Quite a lot of stuff, as you see. Now most of these files are 

missing in the demo version: the protectors left all the working code, they even left 

all the scenarios, but they decided to spare on the (easy to reproduce) *.bmp graphics... go figure...

<BR><BR>

Now, if you want to play the various scenarios, 

you'll have to fake these colored tiles. The best solution is to "recreate" 

them using PSP and the "edit palette" function, 

since in the 'graphics' directory of the demo you'll find some tiles 

("s_units are special units"), have a look through psp, just  

browsing the graphic files inside your toawdemo/graphics subdirectory...:<PRE>

Of course -instead of recreating them editing palettes- you could also <U>steal</U> the missing 

units tiles from any complete version, but then you could just steal the whole game as well, and that's not 

the point of our work at all: we don't want to steal anything: we want simply to use some 

material that has already been stuffed on our harddisks... besides it's way more fun 

to change colors on your own using your own fantasy... :-)

<BR><BR><HR>

Of course now you'r ready to play (almost) ANY scenario, see, for instance those at <BR>

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/'" tppabs="http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/">http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/</A><BR>

Well, now you'r all set, from a strategical point of view, for the next 10 years... 

wonder what will come next  :-)<BR>

Last but not least on the 'wargalmer' site mentioned above (and elsewhere) 

you will also find Ralph Loewen's zipped file <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/graphics/counters.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/graphics/counters.zip'" tppabs="http://www.wargamer.com/toaw/graphics/counters.zip">counters.zip</A> with all 

possible tile sets and graphics 

if you'r really lazy. Take note that some of the terrain tiles are also missing in the demo, you'll encounter 

some funny effects playing the 'israelo-arab' wars, for instance, because the desert tiles are 

missing.

<BR>

<BR>Ah yes, the "load saved game" function is 

disabled in the demo... this is not funny, since some scenarios are huge, and you cannot 

just play the whole night for the sake of it. But you are (supposed to be) a 

reverser, and this is a classical case of 'crippled target functionality', which is

 pretty easy to implement... much too easy in my (biased) opinion: the strings 

immediately reveal it...<BR><BR>As you can easily see, the 'opening scenario' (Load_whatever) 

relevant routines are all at:

An easy patch of the simple code snippet above will land you to the load_whatever part and 

present you a small window for opening 

SCENARIOS (the *.SCE files), yet you will 

be able to easily open your 

(or others') <FONT color=red><U>saved games</U></FONT> as well: 

just <B>(1)</B> navigate to the 'saves' subdirectory 

and then <B>(2)</B> type *.* (or directly *.sav) as a query mask... yes, 

it works (of course)...<HR>

I'll leave as a (relatively) easy exercise for the reader 'how to get the FULL 

editor functionality back'... great fun (and worth your reversing time)... 

you'll actually get a complete working 

and reversed copy of this very good game at the end... but, and this suits my teaching 

approach,  

you'll have to work a little on your own and you will have to understand (at least part of)  

the code... hint: use a flow editor like smartcheck :-)

<BR><HR><H3>MY ADVICE TO THE GAMES PROGRAMMERS</H3>

<BR>

The first obvious lesson you should have learned long ago (seen the 

incredible success of the unsurpassed Steel Panther I, the best ever strategical/tactical game that 

is now -fall 1998- appearing for next to free, complete, on 

some magazine CD-ROM: BUY IT!) is that you should, by all means, give for free 

scenario editors.<BR>

With them you <U>SHOULD</U> offer to the masses the possibility to play home-made scenarios.<BR>

A good protection scheme, that would at the same time work well for the SPREADING of your 

strategic game would therefore be, IMO: give with the demo a couple of scenarii and the 

ability to create (and play) any scenario, PROVIDED THE USER HIMSELF HAS MADE IT. The 

demo will NOT allow the playing of scenarios created by a third party (a very easy 

to implement protection scheme). So the user will have 

a great game (hopefully :-) and he will probably create 

a lot of home-made scenarii for the greater glory of the 'regular' user community, 

in fact only those that will have UPDATED TO THE REAL VERSION will be able to play third-party 

scenarii. The demo users will NOT be able to play scenarii made by a third party 

(well, unless they crack 

the protection scheme, of course, but we are speaking here of normal placid demo-users, not 

of reversers :-)<BR>Final effect: 

lotta people playing the hell out of it (but with a great incentive to register) 

and AT THE SAME TIME working a lot for free in order to spread your game, with 

lotta scenarii coming out and a great incentive 

to update... if you give a good written documentation and if you keep 

the update price low enough, as you should IMO.<BR>

Of course even that can be cracked if necessary, yet note that that would basically 

be THE CONTRARY of what Talonsoft did with this target. Here they 

didn't give anyone the possibility to 

create scenarii with the demo (which would have actually helped the spreading of their 

game) and yet -a silly mistake- gave away with this demo the possibility to play <I>de facto</I> 

any scenario, something that will not help them much actually... a mistake, IMHO.<BR><BR><CENTER>
