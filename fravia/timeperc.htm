                 <I>Well, I like this kind of 'cuts'. I always believed that we have 

all the time we need to do whatever we need. I don't believe in the 

'not having the time' excuse. Is there something you like? Feeling the winds? 

Looking at amoebas through a microscope? Writing a poem? Watching a Landscape? 

Just do it. Take all the time you need. Throw away your watch and your GSM, 

both are just evident (moral and physical) slavery symbols. Feel 

the time of the day with your skin: reverse the days. 

You'll never regret it.<BR>Of course if you are serious you shouldn't tackle time 

problems without your "Grotefend"... Hermann Grotefend wrote in 1891 his 'Taschenbuch der 

Zeitrechnung des deutschen mittelalters und der Neuzeit... and its fifth edition (the 1922's one) 

has been reprinted a zillion 

times. Don't miss that fundamental book if you want to understand what a 'saltus lunae' and 

what a 'circulus solaris' are... I even wrote a small program, long ago (on a Spectrum!), that 

allowed you to calculate and convert all dates of this world based on Grotefend's splendid tables and 

work.</I>

                 <P>Hello Fravia+,</P>



                 <P>I was inspired today by IcE's neato essay on reality cracking to

                 rewrite and update a little essay I wrote last year about the

                 year 2K thingy everyone seems to be so excited about.  I took out most

                 of the Y2K rhetoric and tried to focus more on the perceptions of time

                 and reality cracking.</P>

                 <P><B>Assuming</B> that something good or bad will happen at the turn

                 of this

                 upcoming century is an odd thought. Two thousand is just a number like

                 any other, like eleven, fifty-three or million-six. If you believe in

                 linear time then every year, day, hour, etc. is unique, different, and

                 potentially a threat to human and animal kind--or not. The Earth

                 doesn't know what year it is, what day it is or what hour it is. The

                 Earth speeds itís way around the Sun completely unaware as to what we

                 silly humans are doing (or measuring for that matter.) Nothing bad has

                 ever happened exactly at 12 midnight, January 1st in the year 1 or 100

                 or 1000, and thinking that anything other than "normal" life will

                 continue is a matter of perception, human perception. My watch says

                 it's 9 PM, but yours says it's 6 AM. Go figure.</P>



                 <P><B>Human</B> ways of measuring time (calendars and the like) change

                 every so

                 often. Weíre fickle. What we believe to be the beginning of a new

                 century today may be perceived as the middle of another century in the

                 future. For example, Jewish and Chinese culture do not agree with us

                 misguided euroamerican westerners as to what year it really is. Is it

                 year number 2000 or is it 5700? I donít know for sure, but my paycheck

                 from the man says itís 1998, so it's got to be right, right?</P>



                 <P><B>The</B> Christian Bible (no, Iím not a religious nut, this is

                 just an

                 example so get over it) states that the Earth and everything on it was

                 created in six "days" (on the seventh day, God took a day off) a few

                 thousand (or whatever) years ago. Let's say just for a moment that this

                 is true. Was the calendar as we know it today (12 months, 7-day weeks,

                 365 days, etc.) in use at the time that was written? Nope! So assuming

                 that one "day" back then is the same 24 hours we know and love today is

                 silly, when you also know for a fact that the Earth's own happy

                 rotation is slowing down, making the "days" "weeks" and "years"

                 constantly longer than before, and this has been going on since way

                 before the beginning of human timekeeping. We are measuring the same

                 thing (we hope), time, but are constantly altering our perception of

                 it. Think of how often you have to change the time on your wristwatch.

                 Do you adjust the time every so often? I thought so. See? Even you're

                 doing it!!</P>



                 <P><B>Every</B> year or so timekeeping scientists must adjust our

                 conception of

                 time in order to keep us on an even, precise calendar, so that we donít

                 miss that important meeting or sports game on the telly. Leap year is a

                 good example of this. Every four years, we add a day onto February so

                 as to make sure that 1/4 day we gain every year is taken into account.

                 I find it odd that seventeen whole days was permanently removed from

                 our western calendar a few centuries ago because of this leap year

                 thingy, as if they never existed. Lamers, canít they get it right the

                 first time? Guess not. Letís change it again! A few seconds added or

                 subtracted here and there are seemingly insignificant, but as you

                 calculate the minutes and hours as compared to the number of years that

                 we have been keeping time, the added days and weeks can throw off your

                 whole conception of time, history, life, and when you think last year

                 was.</P>



                 <P><B>Time</B> is relative. See a trend in this essay? Human evolution,

                 what IcE

                 calls "reality conditioning" has defined our perception, because we

                 have learned and think we know how to measure this thing we call time.

                 There are advanced ways of timekeeping that we puny little humans, with

                 our written calendars, watches and other devices, neglect to

                 acknowledge, that wonderful thing we call "biological time." IcE asked,

                 "do animals wear Rolexís? In a way." I say with no small emphasis that

                 whales, butterflies and geese keep time. Not the way we do with

                 machines or other technologies, but with their internal biological

                 clocks. They all seem to happily migrate and travel places "right on

                 time" year after year after year without the use of written language or

                 calendars. Whatís up with that? How can animals be so precise without

                 the aid of technology? Don't we need technology in order to function

                 properly in proper human society? Bah! We humans are handicapped by our

                 material conditioning (our consumerism upbringing) with all this stuff

                 we rely on to simply function on a day to day basis, as animals are

                 precisely unencumbered by this stuff, and still do the same job of

                 functioning just fine without it. How can I keep my little job working

                 for the man if I don't have my alarm clock to wake me up every morning?

                 The Sun?  What's that?  You mean the Sun can wake me up in the morning

                 with mere light?  Scary!  Animals do use technology, so donít think we

                 made tools and the like first. Birds modify sticks to catch beetles

                 underground, monkeys make beds and wash their food with leaves, and

                 even ants have agriculture and use tools that weíve only been making

                 and using for a few thousand years...they have been using them for

                 millions of years...but I digress.</P>



                 <P><B>Are</B> we humans so different from animals (most assume that

                 it's the

                 animals that are the "primitive" ones) because they can't keep our

                 concept of time, read or write any human language? I think it is we who

                 are primitive because we, in all our supposed wisdom of the world

                 around us haven't been able to figure out how geese or wildebeest

                 migrate, or even decipher even one animal language. I can teach my dog

                 to learn, react and respond to German and English words and phrases,

                 but I cannot speak or understand my dogís language of woofs, barks and

                 whines. I think my dog is more advanced than I in many ways, for he

                 knows very well the cross-species human words "cheese" "walkies" and

                 "TV" but I have no idea what the dog word "woof" means.  I might know

                 he was barking at a cat, but I donít know what exactly Big Jim was

                 saying in dog words. "Look, it's the neighbor's cat, and she has

                 kittens, and they look yummy!" Iím illiterate when it comes to

                 dogspeak. No matter how hard I try, I just can't understand "woof."</P>



                 <P><B>Perhaps</B> animals already understand us and our calendars,

                 languages, and

                 computers, and choose not to partake in our silly materialism. Perhaps

                 it is the animals with the true wisdom on this planet, and have the

                 biological technology to not need useless crap to keep track of things.

                 Maybe, just maybe "wetware" is the answer to all the questions we try

                 so hard to solve with machines.</P>



                 <P><B>Time</B> is what you perceive it to be. Make the most of it in

                 your own

                 way, or it will overcome you and take over your life, becoming the

                 focus instead of the instrument for something more important:

                 living.</P>
