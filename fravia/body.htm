<PRE>

                       All of us are trained in the use of speech -- to communicate what

                       we mean in a way that other people will understand. And most of the

                       time, others understand what we mean. In a telephone conversation,

                       we communicate through speech alone. In a face-to-face meeting,

                       part of the communication is carried in a non-verbal form -- what is

                       often called body language. 



                       Why is body language so important? There are two principal

                       reasons: 



                            You have probably heard many times that people remember

                            more of what they see than what they hear. Long after a

                            meeting, we are likely to have forgotten the exact words

                            someone used, but we may retain a vivid image of the same

                            person's facial expression. 

                            Through life experience we have learned, perhaps

                            unconsciously, that people often lie with words. (We're talking

                            here about the little white lies and omissions that are part of

                            many conversations.) But facial expressions and other body

                            language tend to be more honest. When a person's words and

                            body language are consistent, we believe that person. When

                            their words and body language say different things, we tend to

                            believe the body language and doubt the words. 



                       Picture this scenario: You say to a friend, &quot;How was your review

                       with the boss?&quot; Your friend says. &quot;OK&quot; Then her smile vanishes, and

                       her hand tightens around the notebook she is carrying. Did your

                       friend really do OK in that review? Probably not, but she does not

                       want to talk about her true feelings right now. When a person's facial

                       expression differs from their words, your experience tells you to go

                       with the visual cues not the words. 



                       The Vocabulary Of Body Language 



                       Body language, unlike spoken language, is inexact; so you have to be

                       careful about how you interpret it. A certain movement or facial

                       expression may be quite meaningful, or it may mean nothing at all. As

                       a starting point, the lists below provide you with some common body

                       language terms and their generally accepted meanings: 



                       Positive body language

                       Positive body language is generally quite reliable as an indicator of a

                       person's feelings. It signals interest in the other person and in the

                       conversation.



                       Relaxed posture

                       Comfortably seated, relaxed breathing, no visible stiffness or abrupt

                       movements. These indicate no major barriers to communication.



                       Arms relaxed 

                       Uncrossed arms and hands open (palms up or otherwise visible to

                       the other person) are signs of openness. 



                       Good eye contact

                       Looking in the other person's eyes, particularly when they are

                       speaking, indicates interest in that person. Proper eye contact

                       involves looking away occasionally to avoid staring.



                       Nodding agreement 

                       When nods are used to punctuate key things the other person has

                       said, they signal agreement, interest and understanding. However,

                       continual unconscious bobbing of the head usually indicates that the

                       listener is tuning out.



                       Taking notes 

                       Shows interest and involvement, particularly if notes are on what the

                       other person is saying.



                       Smiling/adding humor 

                       This is a very positive sign. It signals a warm personal relationship.



                       Leaning closer

                       Reducing the distance between two people, particularly when the

                       other person is speaking. Indicates interest is up and barriers are

                       down.



                       Gesturing warmly

                       Talking with hands, particularly with palms open, indicates

                       involvement in the conversation and openness to the other person. 



                       For all of these positive gestures, moderation is the rule. When they

                       are exaggerated, they can become more negative than positive. 



                       Negative Body Language 



                       Negative body language is somewhat less reliable as an indicator of

                       the person's comfort with the current conversation than positive body

                       language. Actions that are generally considered negative may just be

                       a matter of comfort for this person, may indicate that the person is

                       tired or may result from other matters that are weighing on this

                       person's mind.



                       Body tense

                       Stiffness, wrinkled brow, jerky body motion, hands clasped in front

                       or palms down on the table. These can indicate concern with the

                       topic or dealing with the other person.



                       Arms folded in front

                       Creates a barrier; can express resistance to what is being said.



                       Hand on face

                       A hand over one's mouth is a closed gesture. Leaning on one's elbow

                       with the chin in the hand can communicate boredom. 



                       Fidgeting

                       Moving around a lot, playing with things and drumming fingers are

                       usually a sign of boredom, nervousness or impatience.



                       Arms behind head, leaning back

                       In a well-established relationship, this can be a relaxed gesture. In a

                       new relationship, it is often used to express a desire for control or

                       power.



                       Yawning 

                       Boredom, confusion. The other person is talking too much or in too

                       much technical detail.



                       Impatience

                       Trying to interrupt what the other person is saying; opening one's

                       mouth frequently as if to speak.



                       Distraction 

                       Eyes flicking about, blank stares, flipping through literature without

                       really reading it, looking at others in the office, looking at the person's

                       body or clothing.



                       Leaning away

                       Avoiding moving closer, even when something is handed to the

                       person, is strongly negative.



                       Negative facial expressions 

                       These include shaking head, eyes narrowed, scowling, frowning. 



                       Combinations Count More Than Individual Gestures



                       Body language is more meaningful when several expressions take

                       place at the same time. For example, the combination of leaning

                       forward, nodding and smiling is a strong indication of agreement and

                       openness. Most meaningful is a matched set of gestures that also

                       agrees with what the person is saying. 



                       Transitions Count More Than Positions 



                       As a rule of thumb, individual body positions or movements are

                       frequently meaningless. Some people's faces form a smile or a frown

                       more naturally than a neutral expression. Some people lean on their

                       hand all the time; others never do it. Some people can't sit in a chair

                       for more than a few minutes without crossing their arms; others sit

                       erect with their hands at their sides. 



                       What is meaningful, however, is a transition from one body position

                       to another. If a person spends the entire meeting leaning forward,

                       that may be just comfort. But if the same person starts out leaning

                       back and then gradually moves forward as the meeting progresses,

                       that's non-verbal communication. 



                       Using Body Language Effectively 



                       There are two ways you can use body language to enhance your

                       face-to-face meetings: 



                            Observe the customer's body language 

                            Control your body language 



                       Observing the customer's body language 

                       From the moment you greet the customer, observe the customer's

                       body language. At the beginning of the meeting, it is normal for

                       customers to appear somewhat reserved or nervous. If this is a new

                       relationship, the customer may not be ready to trust you yet. As the

                       meeting progresses, the customer should normally warm up and

                       begin to display more open body language. 



                       Pay particular attention to any changes in the customer's body

                       language, both positive and negative. Positive moves are buying

                       signals -- you are on the right track and should keep going in the

                       direction where you are headed. Negative moves are objections.

                       They mean that you and the customer are beginning to diverge. Stop

                       the track you are on, and get back in synch with the customer: 



                            If the customer's body language is expressing discomfort or

                            disagreement with what you are saying, you need to uncover

                            the basis for the customer's discomfort and restore the positive

                            track. 

                            If the customer is dropping out of the conversation, it is time to

                            stop talking and ask an open-ended question to get the

                            customer involved again. The more the customer has drifted

                            from the conversation, the more you must go back to the

                            customer's goals and background -- something the customer

                            knows a lot about and cares about.

<PRE>

                       Controlling Your Own Body Language 



                       One person's body language unconsciously influences how the other

                       person in a meeting feels. So you can influence the way customers

                       feel subtly through body language. 



                       Speak a familiar language 

                       Try to use non-verbal vocabulary that is generally understood to

                       convey positive messages. If the customer is a good reader of body

                       language, you are ahead. If the customer is not, you have not lost

                       anything: 



                            Maintain good posture, sitting erect but not stiff, hands visible

                            and open.

                            Avoid closed gestures such as crossing your arms across your

                            chest. 

                            Smile.

                            Maintain eye contact, particularly while the customer is

                            speaking. This says you care about what the customer is

                            saying. To avoid staring, look away occasionally to take notes

                            or to look at materials the customer has brought. 

                            Focus your attention on the customer. Avoid fidgeting or

                            letting your eyes wander while the customer is speaking.

                            These actions will draw the customer's attention away from

                            the conversation and suggest you would rather be somewhere

                            else. 

                            Nod agreement. This is positive if you do it convincingly and in

                            appropriate places. If you do it automatically, it says you are

                            not listening.

                            Occasionally express agreement verbally to reinforce nods. 



                       Reflect the customer's language 

                       Make customers feel more comfortable at first by matching their

                       body language. For example: 



                            If the customer's body language is very open, begin to match

                            it. 

                            If it is reserved or nervous, tone down your enthusiasm a bit to

                            make the customer more comfortable. 

                            If the customer prefers to maintain some distance, avoid

                            moving too closely. 

                            If the customer moves slowly and makes few gestures, avoid

                            extensive gesturing and quick movements. 



                       Using Body Language To Influence The Way The

                       Customer Feels 



                       We normally think of body language as a reflection of what the

                       person is feeling, and that's true. But it is also true that if you change

                       your body language, your feelings will begin to change as well. That's

                       why, when you feel yourself dragging in the middle of the afternoon,

                       a quick walk around the block can rejuvenate you. You also tend to

                       feel better when you put on fresh clothes or if you just smile. 



                       This principle has two practical applications 

                       You can make yourself look and feel better by using more positive

                       body language. The famous football coach Vince Lombardi used to

                       tell his players before an away game, &quot;You've got to look good

                       getting off the bus, and then play a heck of a game.&quot; In other words,

                       if you look and act like a winner at the outset you are more likely to

                       become one. 



                       Body language is contagious. If person X uses relatively neutral body

                       language, and person Y uses positive or negative body language,

                       person X will gradually begin to mirror that. Thus, if the customer

                       starts out neutral or somewhat negative and you are increasingly

                       positive, the customer's body language (and thus their mood) will

                       become more positive as well. 



                       To influence the way the customer feels: 



                         1.Start with body language that is generally considered to be

                            positive. 

                         2.Carefully observe the customer's body language.

                         3.Alter your body language to more closely match the

                            customer's. 

                         4.During the meeting, if you think a more positive tone is

                            desirable, gradually change your body language to be more

                            positive in order to influence the way the customer feels.

                            Always make positive transitions in your body language while

                            the customer is speaking. This says you support the

                            customer's ideas and feelings. If you make changes when you

                            begin to speak, it may say that you are trying to take control. 



                       Additional Body Language Techniques 



                       Match your words and body language

                       The customer will trust you less if you attempt to use body language

                       that differs markedly from what you are saying. If you are honest in

                       both, and use both to express your sincere interest in helping the

                       customer, this will show. 



                       Maintain the right distance 

                       People have a comfort zone for how close they want other people to

                       come; only people they feel very comfortable with are allowed to

                       penetrate within a certain distance. Follow these guidelines to

                       maintain a comfortable distance:



                            Follow the customer's lead 

                            From the moment you greet customers, watch where they

                            stand. This will tell you how close to approach. If they back

                            away a bit after the handshake, maintain a greater distance. 

                         

                            Don't tower over the customer 

                            If you are much taller than the customer, be especially careful

                            to keep a comfortable distance. Once you are seated and the

                            customer communicates more openness, you can begin to

                            approach more closely. 

                            Be careful about touching 

                            A firm, brief handshake is always acceptable for greeting

                            someone you do not know well. Other touching is

                            uncomfortable for many people. 

                         

                            Move closer together at an appropriate time 

                            This is valuable in strengthening the positive relationship. But

                            when you move closer to the customer, do it for a reason: 



                                 You can move closer to the customer to look at

                                 a document together, such as a brochure.

                                 If the customer begins to lean closer, expressing

                                 positive energy towards you, it is OK for you to

                                 lean closer as well.

                       Hypnotic techniques fall into three types: specific words used, actions

                       or body language, and techniques that put you in control. 



                       Words



                       1. Talk in word pictures

                       When you get clients to vividly picture an experience, they are in an

                       ideo-sensory trance. Use words that appeal to the senses of sight,

                       sound, feeling, etc. 



                            Car dealer: &quot;Smell the new car.&quot;



                            Realtor: &quot;Imagine waking up and seeing the beautiful

                            view from your bedroom window.&quot; 



                       2. Use power or action words

                       &quot;Grab it,&quot; &quot;Let's run with it,&quot; or &quot;Just do it,&quot; to motivate clients to

                       action. 



                       3. Take control with verbal commands 



                            You need to buy today.

                            You must have one of these to be competitive.

                            You have to invest in this in order to have a secure future.

                            You need to live in this house.

                            Buy now! 



                       4. Use hot, emotional words

                       Money, gain, new, you, loss, free, love, profit. 



                       5. Use absolutes

                       Words like always and never show self-confidence and inspire

                       trust. 



                       Examples: 



                       &quot;It is always better to join a well-established health club.&quot; 



                       &quot;You will never regret making this decision.&quot; 



                       6. Voice inflection

                       Emphasize positive words and commands to make clients focus on

                       the positive benefits to them:

                       &quot;You will love....&quot;

                       &quot;Buy now and save on the price.&quot; 



                       7. Put spunk into your voice

                       Enthusiasm and energy sell. 



                       8. Say, &quot;How do you feel about that,&quot; not &quot;What do you think

                       about that.&quot;

                       &quot;Think&quot; causes clients to think of objections. &quot;Feel&quot; causes them to

                       think of reasons to buy. 



                       9. Start with higher price first

                       Then, when you show a lower-priced product or a bulk-buy, the

                       price looks good relative to the first price stated. 



                       10. Don't say the word &quot;dollars&quot;

                       For example: $1,286. One thousand, two hundred eighty-six dollars

                       sounds like a lot of money. Twelve eighty-six does not sound that

                       expensive. 



                       Actions Or Body Language



                       1. Touch the client between the wrist and elbow occasionally

                       This eliminates barriers and creates a bond of trust. Remember,

                       people buy from people they trust. 



                       2. Use anchors to successfully close the sale

                       An anchor is a noise, gesture or touch that is given with a positive or

                       flattering statement to the prospect. The anchor is repeated later in

                       the presentation to associate these positive feelings with closing the

                       sale. 



                       3. Nod your head &quot;yes&quot;

                       As you're talking or listening, nod your head whenever anything

                       positive is being said. This causes a feeling of positiveness to be

                       associated with what you are selling. Also, as you nod your head,

                       you will notice that the person you are talking to starts to move their

                       head yes, too. The nodding of their head sends a subliminal message

                       of agreement to their mind, which makes it easier for you to close the

                       sale. 



                       4. Mirror the client: 



                            People trust people like themselves.

                            Mimic the body language of the client.

                            When you and the client are in synch, switch over and see if

                            the client mimics you and your enthusiasm. 



                       5. Smile naturally

                       It is proven that a smile fosters a positive reaction in a client. A client

                       gets a good feeling from a smile and associates it with you and your

                       product or service. People want to buy when they feel good. 



                       6. Use facial expressions

                       Most charismatic people have rubbery faces. So, show emotions on

                       your face to connect with the client's emotions. 



                       7. Walk briskly and with confidence

                       This implies you know what you are doing and that you can be

                       trusted. If you appear weak instead of confident, people will be

                       afraid to take your advice. 



                       8. Have a firm handshake

                       People don't respect wimps. They don't trust or buy form people

                       they don't respect. 



                       9. Don't wait to be seated -- take a seat

                       When two people meet, one person takes the dominant position and

                       the other person takes the submissive. Here, dominant position

                       doesn't refer to the aggressive position but rather the expert one. 



                       10. Use open body language

                       Get excited when the client is interested. Relax if he starts to feel

                       pressured. 



                       11. Have good eye contact

                       People only trust people with good eye contact. 



                       Techniques That Put You In Control



                       Give the client post-hypnotic suggestions such as: 



                            When you review this material after I leave, if any additional

                            questions arise, I want you to pick up the phone and call me.

                            Promise?

                            You will love the added security this insurance policy has built

                            into it.

                            After you have been on the radio for a few months, you will

                            notice that more people are responding to your newspaper

                            ads.

                            Think how excited you will be when you are driving your new

                            car. 



                       2. Use &quot;yes-yes&quot; nail downs

                       It is important to get the client to say &quot;yes&quot; over and over because

                       this sets up a condition of agreement that makes it easier to close the

                       sale later. 



                            &quot;Do you want more profit?&quot; -- &quot;Yes.&quot;

                            &quot;Do you need more money?&quot; -- &quot;Yes.&quot;

                            &quot;It's a beautiful day, isn't it?&quot; -- &quot;Yes.&quot; 



                       3. Find out their style of buying and adapt your presentation

                       accordingly

                       &quot;How did you decide which house to buy when you bought last

                       time?&quot; 



                       When the client answers this question, he is telling you how to sell

                       him (with facts, emotion, ego, etc.). 



                       4. Show empathy by repeating the client's statements, even if

                       you disagree 



                       Client: Your product doesn't work. 



                       Salesperson: You feel my product doesn't work. 



                       5. Move into the future and show a need

                       &quot;As your family grows, you'll need the extra space this house has to

                       offer.&quot; 



                       6. Use &quot;just suppose&quot; to get around objections 



                       Client: I'm not ready to buy. 



                       Salesperson: Just suppose you were, what changed your mind? 



                            Now the client has just told you how to sell him. 



                       7. Take control by asking strong questions such as:

                       &quot;What would it take to get you to buy today?&quot; Or, &quot;What is the main

                       concern you have left?&quot; &quot;Is there something you haven't told me?&quot; 



                       8. Make it fun

                       People hate to be sold, although they love to buy, and they buy from

                       people they like. Don't bore them. Talk to them as you would talk to

                       a friend at a party. This makes them want to see you and buy from

                       you. 



                       9. Memorize answers to recurring objections

                       Top salespeople know what to say to 99% of all objections. Since

                       clients have learned ways to put you off, it makes sense that you

                       learn ways to counter their efforts. In order to stay in control, you

                       have to be able to effortlessly get around whatever stumbling block

                       the client brings up and continue selling until they buy. 



                       10. Repeat the client's hot button several times

                       A famous saying in advertising is, &quot;Nothing sells like repetition.&quot;

                       When a message is repeated over and over, it embeds itself in the

                       client's mind. We must hear something over and over before we act

                       on it. When you give a benefit that the client responds positively to,

                       repeat it often throughout your presentation. Each time you repeat it,

                       the client becomes more and more receptive to buying, so that when

                       you close, buying has become the right thing to do. 



                       11. Use an assumptive attitude

                       Speak as if the client has already bought. 



                       &quot;When you buy this big screen television....&quot; instead of, &quot;If you buy

                       this big screen television....&quot; 



                       These hypnotic techniques can be learned by anyone. Practice them

                       until they are a natural part of your presentation and become

                       undetectable by the client. Hypnotic selling will close more sales and

                       make you more money with less work

                       undetectable by the client. Hypnotic selling will close more sales and

                       make you more money with less work&quot;<BR><B>nice moral and nice ethic! 

These assholes!<BR></B>

You may be interested to know that the enemy of humanity that has written these 

awful words is Pam Lontos, which works for (note the name) &quot;Sales &amp; Motivation Inc.,

in Florida... should you want to contact her, her address is PamLonto1@aol.com</CENTER></I>
