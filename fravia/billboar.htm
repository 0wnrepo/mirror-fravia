<i>Well, I felt necessary to add this small 'marvel' to our reality cracking section, it's a 

extremely intelligent reality cracking essay (or rather 'reality cracking tool' :-) that you 

can find, in its original version, at 

<a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.adbusters.org/Toolbox/billboard.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.adbusters.org/Toolbox/billboard.html'" tppabs="http://www.adbusters.org/Toolbox/billboard.html">http://www.adbusters.org/Toolbox/billboard.html</a>. 

Yet the subject is so fascinating that I decided to host my local copy of it (with images!) on 

my own site! Yes, liberate billboards (keep in mind that we are not paid -far from it- 

for being compelled to slurp all the visual garbage they throw at us everywhere!) Enjoy this 

essay and have fun! :-)

With a little ingenuity, some hammering and sawing in the workshop, 

and a free evening or two, it isn't difficult to liberate a billboard. 

Watch the image (right) to find out how to make your own Billboard Buster -- 

perfect for putting the blemish of truth on those impossibly perfect complexions.

Here are a few ideas for your first liberations:

</p>



<ul TYPE="DISC">

	<li><b>Case of acne:</b> Retouchers remove the blemishes on model's faces in order to create billboard people. The BB MK 1 and the Oil Stick Detoucher seemed ideal for reintroducing the blemishes. By adding acne spots we could turn billboard person who flogs products into real person who couldn't sell a thing.

<br><br>



	<li><b>Zombie eyes:</b> Simply restoring people to normality seemed rather tame, so we came up with some other ideas. Two quick bursts of white aimed at the center of the eyes would turn a billboard person into a zombie from Children of the Damned or Night of the Living Dead. 

</ul>

<p>

<ul TYPE="DISC">

	<li><b>Trickle of blood:</b> A blast of dark red spray paint aimed at the corner of the mouth and allowed to run would make a billboard person look really sick. It would suggest an unfashionable trauma, a distasteful disease, or a nasty bite.

<br><br>

	<li><b>Hitlerizing:</b> Adding a quick Hitler mustache could easily undo the advertising image of an actual person, such as a politician. Because it would suggest the person held fascist views, we thought we should save it for those who belong to the far right.
