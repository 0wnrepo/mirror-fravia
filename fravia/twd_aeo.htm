The cracking of &quot;Age of Empires&quot;

================================

(a general digression about CD-based copy 

protections of most Windows95 games)

by TWD

</CENTER>



Hi back again,



it's going to be Christmas and the whole world is going to shop. 

Advertising is legalized lying, said someone. 

Remember this, especially every time it's Christmas.



Examining a game from big brother Micro$oft (of course we have 

bought it: part NO: X03-44492 :-) we have noticed a bug that may 

annoy all the poor boys (and girls) all over the (poor) world, 

whose's (poor) father and mothers, for instance, have lost their 

(poor) jobs thanks to Micro$oft's (poor) society. 

See: this reversing is a present for those who won't get no 

presents at all during these merry (poor) holidays, poor chaps, 

yet would need <U>so</U> much to evaluate (fully) this interesting 

(if overbloated) historical game... so let's crack it! 

<FONT color="blue">

And anyway I need my own cd-drive free from my own bought CD-games 

in order to hear my own music CD... something against this? :-)

</FONT>

Age of Empires comes on one CD-ROM; the CD-ROM can be taken 

out after the game is running.

I think that this tells us, that there is only one check for the CD at

the beginning, when Age of Empires starts.

<HR>

Little (important) digression

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~



Let's say something general about copy protections of Windows95 games.

They are nearly all the same, and they aren't really copy protections.

They all work something like this :



    (1) put &quot;c:\&quot; in a variable, let's say &quot;xrom&quot;

    (2) test if &quot;xrom&quot; is the CD-Drive, by using &quot;GetDriveTypeA&quot;

    (3) if result = 5 then continue at step 5

    (4) else increment the drive letter and go back to (2)

    (5) use the letter in &quot;xrom&quot; to complete all path names.

    (6) if it will never find a CD-Drive, a error message appears





A lot of games are doing it like this.

How to crack this ??? Nothing easier like this. Don't put &quot;c:\&quot; in the 

variable, but the desired CD-drive letter. Then remove the

&quot;GetDriveTypeA&quot; call and write something like &quot;mov eax, 00000005&quot;. 

Sometimes a &quot;GetVolumeInformationA&quot; follows, but it's no problem 

to avoid the program to exit by this.



Example games for this kind of protection :



  - Beasts and Bumpkins

  - Descent ][

  - Diablo

  - Panzer General IIID

  - and many more





End of digression

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

<HR>

On the &quot;Most stupid protections&quot; <A href="project7.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/project7.htm">+HCU's project</A> is said that the 

more commercial a product is, the more stupid it's protection

will be.

This is sure confirmed if you take a look at &quot;Age of Empires&quot;.



The path to the CD is stored in the registry and only needed to find 

the oversized AVI philez.



Set a breakpoint on &quot;GetDriveTypeA&quot; and start &quot;Age of Empires&quot;.

SoftIce pops up a few times in the &quot;LinkInfo&quot; module, nut this is not 

interesting.

Sometime later, SoftIce pops up in the &quot;Empire&quot; module at 

this position:







:004D65F5 57             push edi                      &lt;-- the CD path

:004D65F6 FF1554267000   Call KERNEL32.GetDriveTypeA   &lt;-- SoftIce pops up here

:004D65FC 83F805         cmp eax, 00000005             &lt;-- Is it the CD-ROM ???

:004D65FF 7404           je 004D6605                   &lt;-- Yes ? --&gt; jump !

:004D6601 33C0           xor eax, eax                  &lt;-- No ?  --&gt; stay !

:004D6603 EB53           jmp 004D6658





In edi is the pointer to the CD path. The result of GetDriveTypeA 

is &quot;00000005&quot; if the checked drive is a CD drive. If the given drive 

is a CD drive, the program continues below :



...



:004D662B 57                      push edi                      &lt;-- the CD path

:004D662C FF1558267000            Call KERNEL32.GetVolumeInformationA

:004D6632 85C0                    test eax, eax

:004D6634 B800000000              mov eax, 00000000

:004D6639 741D                    je 004D6658

:004D663B 8B460C                  mov eax, dword ptr [esi+0C]

:004D663E 8D4C241C                lea ecx, dword ptr [esp+1C]

:004D6642 05FD020000              add eax, 000002FD

:004D6647 50                      push eax

:004D6648 51                      push ecx

:004D6649 E802D60500              call 00533C50                  &lt;-- strcmpi

:004D664E 83C408                  add esp, 00000008

:004D6651 83F801                  cmp eax, 00000001

:004D6654 1BC0                    sbb eax, eax

:004D6656 F7D8                    neg eax





As you can see, not only the type of drive is checked, but also the name 

of the drive.

In ecx is the pointer to the name of the CD currently in your CD-ROM, in 

eax is the pointer to the expected name : &quot;AOE&quot;



If the compare succeeded, the result of the complete function is &quot;01&quot;,

else it is zero.





To patch &quot;Age of Empires&quot;, this function has to return &quot;01&quot; every time

it is called. No problem for us, of course: let's look at the top of 

the function :



:004D6550 81EC0C020000            sub esp, 0000020C

:004D6556 53                      push ebx

:004D6557 56                      push esi

:004D6558 8B410C                  mov eax, dword ptr [ecx+0C]

:004D655B 57                      push edi

:004D655C 55                      push ebp

:004D655D 8BF1                    mov esi, ecx

:004D655F 8B8808040000            mov ecx, dword ptr [eax+00000408]

:004D6565 85C9                    test ecx, ecx

:004D6567 750A                    jne 004D6573             &lt;--blast this one

:004D6569 B801000000              mov eax, 00000001

:004D656E E9E5000000              jmp 004D6658             &lt;--jump to the end



As we can see from the small piece of code above, the only thing which

is to do, is to blast the jne at 004d6567. If this is done, the function

will always return &quot;eax = 01&quot;.



After I nopped out some bytes (in my essay about W32Dasm 8.7) I was mildly 

criticized by fravia+, now I learned and I prefer to use this sequence :



  41   inc ecx 

  49   dec ecx



This one is doing nothing as good as two nops would do, but it can not

be detected by some protection algorithms.



Summary

~~~~~~~



&quot;Age of Empires&quot; was as silly and easy to cheat as most of the time trial

versions, created by Micro$oft. The patch can be reduced to a single &quot;jne 

blasting out&quot;, this should, normally, be too easy to be true, yet most of 

these games compel in such a silly way legitime users to occupy their own 

CD-drive with a CD-ROM they have NOT chosen to have there!



After patching the program, it is even possible to delete all the 

x-tra large avi phileZ, cause they waste nearly 100 megz of space.



Time to pay respect

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Last but not least, 

there are two people I want pay respect to :



  - First fravia+ who hosts one of the most interesting pages on

    the whole net. If you want to find any knowledge about cracking

    (or computers in a more general way), pay a visit to 

    <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.fravia.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.fravia.org/'" tppabs="http://www.fravia.org/">http://www.fravia.org</A>



  - Second to Quine who had cracked IDA in a very special way.

    Disassembling with IDA is much more satisfying, than doing it 

    with good old W32Dasm, just try it.

    I have to say that I was nearly as far with cracking IDA, but 

    my 'working target' kept always crashing, because no mem was 

    reserved. Respects to Quine!



This was our Micro$oft cracking for today, questions can -as usual- 

be asked at :

<I>Of course you should BUY this overbloated game (you better buy a Pentium 200 first, tough) and 

you should NOT come to the idea of using only <U>one</U> Age of empires CD-ROM (if ever... 

you could of course find the razor distributed copy on the web for free, if you seek) in order to 

'seed' this game, as cracked above by TWD, in all your friends and friends' 

friends and friends' friends' friends computers. This would 

be un-ethical, I'm afraid, since Micro$oft and their overbloated programmers slaves 

would risk loosing some money thattaway. So don't do it, you scoundrels! I did'nt, I bought 

my own copy: 0897 Part No. 92681: &quot;Simply fill in the card, choose your local Micro$oft 

office from the leaflet...&quot;</I> :-)</CENTER>
