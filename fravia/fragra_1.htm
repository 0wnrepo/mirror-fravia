Well, I got into your reality cracking page looking for anonimity and I

think it was the best mistake i've ever made. I think I am going to

send you some essays from my own and until I'll be able to do that, I am only

researching and i discovered a home-page that you may find great (See

I'm not one from those guys). As i Know you aren't going to visit pages 

on command, i'll send you some essays from that page to see if you take a

look at it faster.



I must unfortunately warn you: when you first visit that site you'll

see some misthycal boolshits, forget them and just skip that.

                 The fragrance industry is big business, very big business. It includes

                 much more than retail sales of fragrances. Related industries such as

                 chemical companies supply the chemicals the fragrances are made from.

                 Most fragrance chemicals are synthesized from petroleum products. Some

                 companies formulate fragrances and flavors for other companies.

                 Marketing and advertising are used to create and promote the image of a

                 fragrance.



                 Add related industries such as companies that add fragrance to personal

                 care, personal hygiene, and household products and the impact is even

                 greater. The food industry is also a large user of fragrance chemicals

                 known as flavors or aroma chemicals when used in foods. Flavor /

                 fragrance chemicals are also in heavy use by the tobacco industry as

                 additives to cigarettes to enhance flavor, especially the lower tar and

                 nicotine brands. 



                 Virtually every aspect of our lives is impacted by the Fragrance

                 Industry. In the past many products had generic scents that identified

                 their use, rather than brand. All soaps had an odor that was identified

                 as "soap". Most laundry detergents had the basic same odor and most

                 cleaners either had a pine or lemon scent. This is no longer the case. 



                 Laundry smells fresh for days. Advertising campaigns are based on the

                 odor rather than the performance of products. Entire industries are

                 built around the perception of odor. The sense of smell is the least

                 understood of the senses and often considered the less important of the

                 senses. Yet it is the basis of multi-billion dollar industries.



                 "Why is fragrance so important to the buying public? The key is a

                 mixture of biological response, psychology, and memory. The limbic

                 system is the most primitive part of our brain and the seat of

                 immediate emotions." (Scent of a Market American Demographics August

                 1995)



                  



                 History:



                 Initially perfumes and fragrance materials came from plant or animal

                 sources. Fragrance played an important part in religious observations.

                 It was thought to have powers to heal and protect from evil. The

                 history of fragrances goes backs centuries. The Bible documents using

                 balms, ointments, and scented oils. For the Egyptians it was part of

                 the burial ritual and a symbol of status. The Greek believed fragrance

                 could be used as a connection to the Gods. The Romans used perfumes for

                 seduction and used herbs as aphrodisiacs.



                  With the Middle Ages and the fall of the Roman Empire there was a

                 decline in the use of perfumery. The main use of strong fragrances was

                 to cover the stench of disease. During the Crusades, Europe was

                 introduced to perfumery from the East. From the Arabs there was gained

                 the knowledge of alchemy and distillation of essential oils. Venice

                 became the center of the perfume trade. Gradually perfumery spread to

                 other European countries.



                  



                 During the 14th Century perfumes were considered frivolous and abusive.

                 During this time the main purpose of essential oils were medicinal.

                 During the 15th and 16th centuries bathing was unpopular because it was

                 thought to open the pores up and allow diseases in. Fragrances were

                 used to cover up the odors from not bathing.



                 Fragrances were used by the upper class from the 16th to 19th

                 centuries. Only the wealthy could afford the luxury of perfumes. The

                 art of perfumery flourished. France became the center of the perfume

                 industry.



                 In the late 1800's the first synthetic fragrance material was produced.

                 This was the beginning of the modern age of perfumery. With the event

                 of synthetics, perfumery would no longer be exclusively used by the

                 wealthy. The average person would be able to afford fragrances. By the

                 19th century there were more than 300 manufactors of fragranced

                 products employing more than 20,000 people. (For more detailed

                 information on the ancient history of perfumes visit Internet Parfum)



                 In 1868 Houbignat introduced the first perfume containing a synthetic

                 material. That material was coumarine. In 1874, Vanillin was

                 introduced. By the early 1900's synthetics were being used on a regular

                 basis. The main materials were still of botanical or animal origin with

                 synthetics used to complement and add new dimension to the naturals. 



                 In 1921 Chanel No. 5 was introduced. It was the first fragrance that

                 was dominated by the use of synthetic aldehydes. It contained about 1%

                 aliphatic aldehydes. It was the first of a class of perfumes called

                 floral aldehydes. Even then the majority of the formula was made from

                 naturals, softening the harshness of the aldehydes. The trend continued

                 to be dominated with natural materials. Synthetics were used to expand

                 the types of fragrances that could be created. 



                 After World War II there was an explosion of new synthetics. More and

                 more were incorporated into perfumery. Naturals were used to soften

                 synthetics. Synthetics were less expensive and supplies were more

                 reliable. However, the synthetics were often harsh and lacked the

                 softness lended by naturals. So naturals remained an important part of

                 the formulas.



                 Fragrance formulas were closely guarded secrets. The fragrance industry

                 was a truly secretive one and only a few trusted individuals would have

                 access to a formula. Developing perfumes was a time consuming process

                 accomplished by skilled perfumers. It often took years of experience to

                 attain the skill needed.



                 Formulas could not be patented. The only way to prevent them from being

                 copied was not to divulge the ingredients. Fragrance formulas came

                 under "trade secret" laws. This meant the contents of the formulas did

                 not have to be listed. Only the word "fragrance" had to be put on the

                 label. In this way the secrecy of the formulas was more or less

                 protected.



                  



                 Modern Trends 



                 Gas chromatography and Mass Spectrometry brought about tremendous

                 change in the Fragrance Industry. No longer could the secrecy of

                 formulas be maintained. A skilled fragrance chemist with GC/MS

                 equipment could analyze a fragrance and pretty closely duplicate a

                 fragrance. Copies of expensive, exclusive fragrances were now available

                 at a fraction of the cost.



                 Along with the ability to copy other perfumes, came the ability to

                 analyze natural materials. Now closer matches could be made in

                 duplicating natural materials. There was less need to purchase

                 expensive natural materials. Synthetics could be blended to better

                 imitate the naturals. Synthetic materials as a rule are less costly,

                 the quality is easier to maintain, and the supply is more reliable.



                 These changes made mass production of fragrances widespread. The market

                 became even more competitive. Advertising and marketing campaigns now

                 accounted for most of the cost of perfumes. Image became the

                 all-important selling feature of a fragrance.



                 Trickle down fragranced products became popular. Shampoos, lotions, and

                 soaps were now available in the same scent as one's favorite perfume.

                 In order to compete other brands now had to have distinctive scents.

                 The generic scent for products no longer existed. 



                 Marketing became the most important aspect of whether a product was

                 successful. And fragrance has become the basis of that marketing.

                 Skilled advertising campaigns create the image and convince consumers

                 that their product will make them happy, sexy, mysterious, alluring,

                 etc. 



                 Your child's clothes have that fresh smell so everyone knows you have

                 done a good job. While sweating is acceptable, smelling like sweat is

                 not. Your hair must smell terrific, your soap must be fresh as spring,

                 and your clothes smell mountain fresh.



                 A good perfume has been traditionally formulated to last six to eight

                 hours. There were three notes. The first note was the first impression

                 of the fragrance immediately out of the bottle. The second note was the

                 body of the fragrance and took a bit do develop after it was on the

                 skin. The third note was the lingering quality of the fragrance. The

                 key to a good perfume was for these three notes to flow into each other

                 to produce a pleasing effect. Colognes and other products were less

                 concentrated and the odor did not last as long. 



                 Now detergents are advertised make your clothes smell fresh for days.

                 With most personal care, personal hygiene, and household products being

                 scented there is a constant bombardment of fragrance. For a product to

                 be distinctive, it must be able to be detected over this "background

                 noise" of fragrance.



                 The trend is for immediately powerful fragrances that are long lasting.

                 Gone is the gradual development and gradual fading of a fragrance. The

                 impact is immediate and long lasting. And of course, to keep up with

                 the competition, all fragrances have to be immediate and long lasting.



                 Over the past 20 years there has been a phenomenal increase in the use

                 of fragranced products. Problems are emerging from this increase
