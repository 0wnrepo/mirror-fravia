This "award" was made for me by Master <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.ice.org/~davinci/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.ice.org/~davinci/'" tppabs="http://www.ice.org/~davinci/"> 

DaVinci</A>, the greatest artist of the cracking world, in late 1998. 

Since all readers descending so deep inside my site are 

automagically supposed to be able reversers 

and therefore capable of reversing all possible meanings of 

any images as well, 

I won't bother to point out the Moebius tape, nor the +HCU's cross in 

red email (because I'm a 'red' reverser) on a golden subtle mace 

that recalls the style of the juwels used by the russian 

Zars... I just hope you'll have at least noticed the potentially "subversive" 

color of 

the reversed letters 'f'... and also 

the light rays contrasting the dark night of knowledge we're all 

at the moment compelled to live in :-)
