<I>I will just publish, from now on, the essays I like <U>exactly as I get them</U>.

<BR>

Authors are invited to<UL>

<LI>1) download the source code;

<LI>2) correct it;

<LI>3) <B>very important</B> CHECK on an Opera browser that it looks ok;

<LI>4) resend it to me corrected

</UL>

And I'll update it.

<HR width=33%>

Note that if the essay should infringe on anyone copyrights, and if I receive a legitimate request 

to nuke it, it will immediately disappear from my site, so you always better write software reversing 

essays that are not "specific" target related... so, pointing out deficiences is OK, 

 individuating "software black holes" is a must, but 

explaining lamers 

how to register (or, even more silly, how to make a coward keygen for the idiots) is definitely NOT "fraviatiquette".<BR>

Indeed from now on I want to HELP, not to damage programmers.

<HR width=33%>

This said I publish this bad formatted but extremely useful essay by Surreal5 with pleasure: 

Stalking (in the sense WE are using this) is indeed a more and more important art on this web 

of ours, as many readers and contributors of my messageboard know (even too well :-)

<HR size=1>

<PRE>something for your stalking section maybe ?

keyboard identification



When communicating with someone over internet, you

can't always

be sure that they are who they say they are,

especially in the area of

computer security. This goes double when they make no

untypical spelling 

or language errors.(!) 



knowing the various keyboards (or analyzing strange

typo's in text's,

comparing them 

to keyboards) can tell you a lot about the person who

wrote it. In some

cases it can 

tell you what country they are in, where they are from

originally, and what 

computer they are using. Whereas phonetical typo's

require lots of text,

and lots of work 

analyzing them in order to be accurate (many countries

have similar

phonetics, 

many languages sound alike), keyboard related typo's

give faster, and

sometimes

more accurate indications. In communicating with

people in 4 languages,

i've noticed 

more than a few giveaways.





1) the switched keyboard typo



typing the key that would hold the right character on

another language

keyboard, are 

dead giveaways, but the situation is rare.



2) the neighbourkey typo



know your neighbouring keys, when in relaxed state

over the keyboard, just

before typing, 

both hands tend to be positioned inward and downward

of the keys, so if

they make a typo, 

it's more likely they press the key positioned

inward/downward from the

center of the 

keyboard, in relation to the key they meant to press.

once you know your

keyboards you 

will see in a glance which keyboard they are using. 



Many people are one handed or dominantly right or left

handed typers, you

can generally 

determine this from a few typo's already. The typing

style influences the

minimum and 

maximum boundries of the keyboard operated with each

hand. Slow typers in

real time are

very unlikely to be equally bi-handed typers, and

possibly even single

finger typers ;).



an example of a right-handed, autodidact typer's

median hand boundries: 



|-----------------------|

| left	 /		|		

|       /		|	

|      |	right	|	

|      \		|	

|	\		|	

|-----------------------|



3) the missing number



missing numbers are very common typos for some non-US

keyboards, 

that have the numbers under shift in the top row

instead of the 

characters, like the widely used french speaking

variety AZERTY.

Because of this they are more inclined to use the

numbers 

on the keypad, and forget to turn on numlock. 

note: this also goes for keyboards where the numbers

are only present

on the keypad ;)



4) the symbol typo



by far the hardest to learn how to spot, but dead

giveaways, and more

accurate. Non-US 

keyboards often have rearranged characters. even

countries that use qwerty

keyboards

often make small adjustments to fit those used in

their language more

often, or to 

include currency or other symbols.



note: keep an eye out for funny characters. hehe 



(!) english isn't my native language
