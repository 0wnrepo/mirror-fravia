course will not do: <I>quelle vulgarit»</I>... besides, this logo is not

as you see a page that has lot of counters and "awards logo" in 'pole position',

<I>"<B>Fravia</B> is one of my favorite sites of the Net.<BR>

His "reverse engineering" studies and exposes of embedded applets in these new languages 

are invaluable. A few hours of reading his collection of studies gives folks like me a whole 

new perspective on how to debug our own applications. Altough Fravia focuses on protection schemes, 

those are the only ones widely distributed and available worldwide as study targets. My world 

has many many occurrences of code taking wrong branches that has nothing to do with 

protection schemes... but the tracing algorithms I learn from him are extremely useful to me 

in finding out, for instance, why a motor does not turn like it was supposed to in a 

robotic welder, or how to port ancient software to use different hardware, to substitute 

for hardware that is no longer available"</I><BR>~</CENTER>

<I>Dear <B>fravia</B>, thanks a lot for your site -- it is great! I've got a lot of

lessons from here as a shareware programmer. By the way, you host a 

very interesting article telling how to crack my own

program (Advanced Disk Catalog, old version, though) <A href="aesc_adc.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/aesc_adc.htm">there</A> 

(just to let you know who am I). The protection, of course, was 

really stupid. I've improved

it a little bit in the latest version (version 1.20, this is not an

invitation to crack it, btw :) Anyway, I wish you luck -- please continue 

your good work. I

think every shareware programmer should visit your site before

releasing his/her "brand-new uncrackable protection".  

Sincerely, Vladimir

<I>...Once again, thanks for the great site. I'm a shareware author 

myself (CuteFTP), and I found a lot of useful info already (and I 

only spent a day there!). Hope my next protection scheme will be 

tough enough to last a few weeks, so that some of the lamers 

out there will get tired of waiting and actually pay for it :)

...as a shareware author, i'm pleased to find my programs cracked. And

this is why: the little .COM app cracks only work for specific versions

and since i constantly put out new versions, the cracks are obsolete

before anyone can ever see them. you might want to mention that in your

page somewhere. Huge companies like M$ and Adobe can't put out 2

versions each week. small shareware authors can, and i do. By flooding

the world with dozens of different versions, an author can keep crackers

very busy. and, no i'm not putting out bug fixes, i respond to users and

add features. and yes, i charge for my programs, but not much: just

enough to keep my web sites alive... now if i could just kill all the 

serial # pages run by "StUpiD LoNeLy

...years ago when there were people with flair

and a clue, like Pengo. Now the hacking man of the hour is

Kevin Mitnick, a seemingly smart man who went to jail after

devoting an insane amount of effort to annoying a computer

security expert about his nationality. What really impressed

me though was your <A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">reality cracking</A> section, it was hard for

me to believe that you actually had Noam Chomsky essays on

your site. That's what it's all about, mixing political

beliefs with computer knowledge, instead of wasting your

time getting "warez". Micheal Moore once talked about the

potential of the Internet: that Internet was for spreading ideas

and educating people, but that it was bogged down with

commercial garbage. On a side note I find it amazing that

your lessons explain things i assumed to be insanely

technical in a clear, humble, and relatively simple way...</I>

this kind of awards are sites 

with a plethora of na‘v, slow loading and mostly never seen before little banners

<B>Fravia</B> is doing a great job and I don't think that people 

will ever

appreciate it enough, he has my respect.<BR>

He recently took a controversial position and 

there are some that believe he's betraying +ORC's ideas. I don't think 

so. My idea of ZEN is 'feeling the code', and  this is, in my opinion, 

what reverse engineering is all about:

achieving high level programming skills, 'feeling' the code... 

I don't see how anyone can object to that, certainly not

the great +ORC</I>
