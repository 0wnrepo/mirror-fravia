<BR>

Most licence agreement (that thing that you click "I agree" on and never read, 

where you agree to give up your first born child and let your sister be 

sold as a slave :-) include a clause that prohibits reverse engineering. A couple of 

examples... 

<FONT color=purple><PRE>

Note that you should not "reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate,

allowed to examine... <BR><BR><HR>

Here another example:<FONT color=purple><PRE>

TERMINATION



The license will terminate automatically if you  fail  to  comply

with  the limitations described herein.  On termination, you must

destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation.</PRE></FONT>

<BR>

Here there seems to be an interesting possibility. I reverse the 

software. License has been violated and terminate. I then destroy 

all copies of the software, and have then respected the licence. And so 

on <I>ab absurdo</I>. Like the never-ending sentence  

"All crackers are liers, lied the cracker". <HR width=44%>

<CENTER><A name="efe"></A><H2><FONT color=gray>Eye for eye</FONT></H2>

(Let's produce our own preliminary agreements and let's alien 

software sign them)</CENTER>

<BR><BR>



OK, it is clear that such 'scarecrow' agreements are as 

funny and 

preposterous as you wish, yet of course NOT legally binding. Let's 

demonstrate it <I>ab absurdo</I>: If they were legally binding, then ANY 

agreement of this sort would be, and then anyone, you or me,  

could prepare on his own a small program (I promise that I'll really 

write it myself as soon 

as I find the time) that acts as a small 'wrapper' for all this kind 

of software (I really wish that a good lawjer will correct this 

in 

order to make our own 'legal scarecrows' even more dangerous-looking than 

those used by some softwarehouses...):<FONT color=purple><PRE>

Your software is entering my private computer. By trespassing 

this memory point you  agree to allow complete  possession of 

your  software to the  legitime  owner of this  computer, and 

specifically you  completely and irrevocabily  agree to allow 

any attempt to modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile,

disassemble or create derivative works based on this Software 

that the legitime owner of this memory (i.e. me :-) fancies.

You also declare as void and inexistent any other conditions-

agreements  regarding your  software that  may preposterously 

be triggered by your software inside the RAM hosting you.

Finally  you  accept  also  COMPLETE  RESPONSABILITY  for any 

malfunctioning your software will have caused to the owner of 

the  hardware  you  are  herewith  allow to visit ONLY if you 

accept this.



If you don't wish  to  accept these  conditions, please leave 

immediatly this private memory and fully remove your software 

from this private hardware.

By trespassing this  memory point you  have completely agreed 

to the above. 

              [add date with hours, minutes and seconds here] 

 [add 'Signature' with the version name of the software here]</PRE></FONT><BR>.

Ab absurdo, as I said... yet, see, either both "agreements" are valid or neither 

is... you cannot have the cake and eat it.<BR>I would say that we could keep it this way: anyone 

may reverse the hell out of everything, provided he does not steal or sell 

alien code.<BR>

The only binding texts are the NATIONAL LAWS governing software 

reversing and we have already  seen that (at least in the <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www2.echo.lu/legal/en/ipr/software/software.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www2.echo.lu/legal/en/ipr/software/software.html'" tppabs="http://www2.echo.lu/legal/en/ipr/software/software.html">European  

Union</A>):<FONT color=green><PRE>

 5(3): The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program          

       shall be entitled, without the authorization of the rightholder, 

       to observe, study or test the functioning of the program in 

       order to determine the ideas and principles which underlie any 

       element of the program if he does so while performing any of 

       the acts of loading, displaying, running, transmitting or 

       storing the program which he is entitled to do.</PRE></FONT>.

(Let's click our 'I disagree' button)</CENTER>

<BR><BR>

Now, this said, I cannot understand why a cracker (one of the most intriguing 

heroes in modern society) should not use his superior knowledge

in order to avoid ANY silly trick or bogus legal mumbo-jambo, in life 

and in software life as well.

<BR><BR>

So let's see: let's take as target "Window Washer", by Webroot software.

<BR><BR>

There you can read the following preposterous text:<FONT color=purple><PRE>

YOU MAY NOT:

(i)   sublicense, rent, sell,  or lease any portion Window Washer;

(ii)  reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, 

      make any attempt to discover the source code of Window Washer, 

      or create derivative works from Window Washer; or

(iii) continue use of Window Washer after your 30 day trial.</PRE></FONT>

<BR>

Well, I don't like it: of course I wish to reverse engineer, decompile, 

disassemble modify and make any attempt to discover the source code of 

any application running on my ram... why shouldn't I? 

<BR><BR>

This puts me in a difficult situation: I cannot agree with this clause, 

yet the demande made is as much as my conscience, verging on the border of

 that that fine line which divides honesty from dishonesty, would tolerate...

<BR><BR>

So let's reverse THIS AGREEMENT first of all:

<BR><BR>

1) Fire the Customizer (you'll find it -uncracked) in my <A href="tools.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tools.htm">tools</A> section, 

crack it first.

<BR><BR>

2) Fire Window Washer (actually it's 'setup' module).

<BR><BR>

3) identify the main agreement window with the customizer, you'll see that's 

Class: TForm4; Title: License Agreement & Disclaimer; Handle (here) 0x0644; 

Dimensions: 373x557 at 61,216; 

<BR><BR>

4) now point the customizer to the small button 'Agree', you'll see that's 

class Tbutton; ParentClass: TForm4; Dimensions: 25x75 at 395,378.

<BR><BR>

5) Now choose the label 'Text' Inside the customizer. And type under 'Nex Text': 

'I Disagree' (or whatever you fancy :-)

<BR><BR>

6) Since I didn't agree, I'm not bound to the list of no-no-no. Yet don't worry: 

I won't translate nor modify this crap.

<BR>

<HR>

So easy it is. And yet this i quite interesting, not only for software license agreements, bu 

also for many more legal paraphernalia that are now appearing on the web everywhere. 

Let's see more 'in deep' the code used by a normal application for this kind of stuff...

<HR>

... to be continued, your suggestions, additions, critics and modifications are welcome... 20 October 1998...
