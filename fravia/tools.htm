There is not a single cracked or pirated copy of software on this or any other

There is no need, since you will learn not only how to understand, reverse and

<FONT color=red>everything</FONT> you want (BTW, if you do not know how to search 
the web, leave this cracking stuff alone for a while, go learn 
"<A href="howtosea.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howtosea.htm">searching</A>" and come back only when you are done</FONT>

You'll therefore find here only shareware

it's an INCREDIBLY 
good tool, it deserves to be paid for. Softice for DOS, Windoze95 and NT in its various versions 
 is the OFFICIAL +HCU debugger since 1997. Btw, there is NO NEED to have 
always the absolute last version of any program, even if the last version 4 promises some 
inetersting web-debugging possibilities,  
you'll still go quite a long way with good old (and stable) sice 3.25!<HR width=33%>
Hope it's not necessary to recall you that you can make MACROs with Softice, here a nice 
couple by Incubus++:<PRE>
macro PARAMS = "dd ss:esp+4" and then bpx GetDlgItemTextA DO "PARAMS"</PRE> or else

the process, then use the "goto code location" option in the MAIN top window to go to the part of code

 Eable Undocumented API Details
