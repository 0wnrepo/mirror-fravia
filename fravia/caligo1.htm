I. INTRODUCTION



Every day new hpacv-pages are created, but most of them disappear/

are deleted some days or weeks later. The worst thing you can do is

to upload all the necassary files and the page 'as-is' to a Free   

Webpage Provider like Geocities or Tripod (that are the two most   

frequently used sites providing 2megs).

But how to create a 'secure page' ? That's what I want to tell you.

I cannot promise you a &quot;successfully and calm life&quot; with an illegal   

page on the Net. But just read on ...



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------



II. USING RELOCATORS



The first thing is the URL... If your page has to move too often,

you'd have to tell the new address to every visitor your page ever

had... nearly impossible.   

A solution could be an url-relocator. There are many of these free

services on the Net, eg.



http://home.pages.de/ (a german one)

http://www.netforward.com/

http://www.ml.org/

http://www.poboxes.com/ (not free)

and many more ...



You get a kind of 'virtual url' that relocates to the   

real place where your homepage lies.   



ATTENTION: These services are not *totally* secure, all of them   

           could delete your account.



Another possibility is a small homepage forwarding to the real URL,

example:

================

<HTML>

<HEAD>

 <META http-equiv="refresh" content="0; URL=http://real.url/~place/">

</HEAD>

<BODY>

Click here to go to my main page:   

<A HREF="http://real.url/~place/" >real.url/~place/</A>.

</HTML>

================



You can change the URL in it to your main account and upload this   

small HTML-document to a permanent URL (for example at a Free Webpage   

Provider, more information at section V).   

It will automatically forward the users to the main page.

ATTENTION: Not every browser supports the Refresh-command. The best

way to make your 'relocator' compatible is to include your main URL

as a link.

* Do not forget to change the address in it before uploading it! ;-) *



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------



III. USING REMAILERS



Let's say you got a free page and email-account on Geocities. If

they delete your acc, nobody could ever reach you (over your Geo-eMail).

To avoid this, you can use remailers. They forward your mail to

your real account. If your real address changes, you can change the

remailer-settings. More about this remailers under the following

addresses:



http://www.netforward.com/

http://www.hempseed.com/

... many more ...



Another advantage of this remailers:

Nobody can see what your internet provider is. They cannot trace

you back simply by looking at the email-address (compuserve.com,

aol.com ...).



If you want to be real ANONYMOUS on the Net, use this:



For eMail: help@weasel.owl.de       (and more...)

For Web:   use www.anonymizer.com   (disadvantage: very slow)



But this tutorial does not want to be a &quot;HOWTO be anonymous on the

Net&quot;. Get more information through other sources.



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------



IV. CREATE A GOOD PAGE/PREPARING



Before trying to find a good provider (see part V) you have to prepare

your pages:



It is always good to have some fake-pages on (*never* use index.htm /

index.html as your main page!!).   

The more fake-pages you have on, the more secure your 'real' main   

page is. Here are some tips about creating fake-pages:



CONTENTS:  linklist, personal greetings, something about 'you',

           your hobbies, big pictures or something similar;

           perhaps a counter, guestbook.



ATTENTION: never use YOUR OWN preferences (pictures or names),   

           just try to imagine a good name and look for good

           pictures on the Net for a person looking like a

           gay ;-]]



If you are using some relocator, you can create some not easy-to-find

address like labaala.htm for your main page. Pay attention that there

is *no* link on one of the fake-pages (normally you only need one) to

this page, just let the relocator forward there.



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------



V. CHOOSING THE 'BEST' PROVIDER



The best webspace would be an account on a 'secure' provider, eg. if

you know the admin and/or asked for the permission to put up the

&quot;illegal&quot; files. If you have this, you don't have to read this

part.



Another good way is to choose MORE THAN ONE provider:



One account for the main pages (little account on a frequently used   

provider, not Geocities or Tripod, you don't need 2meg; it don't even

has to have FTP-upload, Web-Upload is enough) and another account

for the filebase [only if you really need to have some illegal files

up]. This 'file-account' has to be bigger than the first account,

FTP-upload preferred.

If you apply for an account where you have to enter some reasons or

the content of your pages, just enter something like that:



For the first accounts [pages] enter: &quot;Just a little private

homepage&quot;.

For the file account enter something like: &quot;My small private

homepage with some of my own programs&quot;.



Don't forget to put your fake-pages on *BOTH* accounts up !!!



But why to use 2 accounts and not one? That's simple:

On many servers LINKS are NOT ILLEGAL, if the files do not

lay on there server.

And if one of the accounts got deleted, you don't have to

create/upload BOTH pages and files.



To be sure that your files won't be deleted soon, create more

accounts on different servers, create a directory like &quot;warez&quot;

or &quot;illegal&quot; and upload some commercial software/cracks or

hacks. Come back some days/weeks or even months later and look

which accounts had been deleted and which are still up.

Use this remaining server(s) for your filebase.



Another hint: Do never use Geocities or Tripod; they have extensive

checks on illegal pages. And 2meg are not much, you can easily find

accounts with 5meg and even more.



If you have your pages up, you can try to get an even MORE secure

place for your pages and files:

Ask on the IRC if someone want's to sponsor your hacking/cracking/

warez or whatever-page on the chan of your interests. Do not demand   

for big webspace at first.

If you got some offers, ask some questions in a private chat:



 - is there the possibility to upload by ftp?

 - how about the legal risks?



When you successfully got your account, ask the admin if he can

provide a simple pop3/smtp (email)-account. Now you are independent...



 ------------------------------------------------------------------------



VI. FREE WEBPAGE PROVIDER OVERVIEW



There are more than 150 webspace providers, so I cannot provide

a comprehensive list here.

Take a look at the following pages:



http://FWPreview.home.ml.org/  [very good page with mailinglist]

http://payfree.home.ml.org/    [german site]



A search on &quot;FREE WEBPAGES&quot; or &quot;FREE SPACE&quot; (on the Web *AND*

Usenet) could be very successful, too.



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------



VII. WORDS



I hope you are now abled to create a permanent site with illegal   

contents after reading my little tutorial.

You can contact me by emailing caligo@lords.com or visiting my

webpage at http://cracking.home.ml.org/ (both are remailers   

described under section II and III !! :-)). But DO NOT ask me to find   

space for you ! I won't reply to any requests.</PRE>
