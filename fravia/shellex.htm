<PRE>

&gt; This is quite interesting. Never noticed it myself. Would you please

&gt; write a small essay on this explaining CLEARLY and SIMPLY what's

&gt; (probably) going on? This will set the ball rolling. If you add a

&gt; (bogus made but working) web address you'll get quite a lot of input

&gt; and even if your essay/solution/approach is not 100% correct we'll all

&gt; quickly get things straight.

&gt; awaiting your work.

ShellExecute and Your Default Browser



If you are a MSIE user please don't bother reading this article. It

will have little interest for you. 



If you use one of the other browsers I have a little experiment for you

to try:



     Open a DOS window. 

     Type: "<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.somewhere.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.somewhere.com/'" tppabs="http://www.somewhere.com/" target=_blank>http://www.somewhere.com</A>" -- without quotes of course ;-) 

     Press Enter and wait. 



All computers with MSIE installed as the default browser will have

their browser invoked and the page www.somewhere.com will be 

invoked -- provided it exists. 

Last time I checked there was no such active page. 



Most computers with an alternate browser (such as Netscape) installed

as the default will have their browser invoked. 



However, and here is where the problem lies, not all computers with an 

alternate browser respond to this command. 



"So what's the big deal," you may ask. "How many times does one type

'<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.somewhere.com\'/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.somewhere.com\'/'" tppabs="http://www.somewhere.com'/" target=_blank>http://www.somewhere.com'</A> 

at the dos prompt?" 



This is just a symptom. The registry entries and command shell being

used to process the dos command appears to be the same as that used 

by most programs that try to link from within their

code to the default browser. 

Many programs such as Pegasus have the user configure 

the browser link by hand. Other programs such as 

GameSpy (yes, I'm a quake player) rely upon the

ShellExecute() command to call up the default browser. 



For most of my buddies they can just click on the "Upgrade 

to Latest Version" button and GameSpy automatically brings 

up the default browser pointed at the download page. 



"So what's the big deal," you may ask. "Why not just load 

the browser yourself and go to the download page? What's the 

matter: ya lazy or something?"



I'm something.



And that something is pissed. 



I have an attitude. A bad attitude. I don't like bullies. 

I don't like people that use their power, weight, position, 

wealth, or size in any measure to push around the weaker.

That is exactly what Microsoft is doing. 

They have hidden the answer to my question: "How the hell 

do I make my default browser come up with ShellExecute()?" 



Those son-of-female-dogs have not seen fit to publish 

anywhere that I can find which registry keys

are involved in this process. There is no wizard for 

making your Opera browser the fully functional

totally integrated default browser. This means that if 

you want ALL features implemented you have

to use MSIE. 



I have tried searching the registry for codes that need 

changing. I compared a "working" registry with

one that wasn't. I exported from the good and imported 

into the bad (in case my typing was off). 

I have run around in circles trying to "fix" the 

non-MSIE computers to run seamlessly. 



I haven't as yet been able to make it work.



I'm not the world's greatest Win95 programmer. But I do 

know may way around a bit. 



If there is anyone out there that knows the exact keys 

that need to be modified in a registry so that

an alternate browser can be made into a fully functional 

totally integrated default browser please

have the goodness of heart to send them to 

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=shellex@hotmail.com&YY=27620  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=shellex@hotmail.com&YY=27620'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=shellex@hotmail.com&YY=27620">shellex@hotmail.com</A>. 

I will verify that they work and do my best to post the 

answer everywhere I can and back here. 



Or, maybe you can give me a clue on how to crack the 

ShellExecute() function so that I can follow

what in that mythologically-ultra-hot-place is going on. 



It like totally rubs me the wrong way that Microsoft is 

giving themselves this edge over all other

browsers by virtue of hidden and secret information. 



Please don't send me the url for Stuart Patterson's article. 

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.wdj.com/archive/808art.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.wdj.com/archive/808art.html'" tppabs="http://www.wdj.com/archive/808art.html" target=_blank>http://www.wdj.com/archive/808art.html</A>.

I've already found and used that article about as far as 

it will go. It does have a nice workaround for

standalone applications. However there is the annoying 

problem of multiple invocations of the

browser. Every function call will open a new instance of the browser.

Not too satisfying. 



If you know how to modify his sample so that multiple instances 

of the program don't happen then that might help. In that 

case please send me 

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=shellex@hotmail.com&YY=27620  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=shellex@hotmail.com&YY=27620'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=shellex@hotmail.com&YY=27620">shellex@hotmail.com</A> 

the code sample. 

Be forwarned I will share this code with a friend that 

will share it with every third-party web program developer 

he can find. GameSpy, Pegasus, Opera, Mozilla.Org, etc., 

etc.. 

Anything to take about the edge that MicroSoft has. 



Or, if you are interested in taking down MicroSoft on 

notch. How about working with us to produce

a Wizard that will scan the complete registry and make 

YOUR selected browser the default browser?. 

We can post this little utility as FreeWare on the net 

and let all the little Mom's and Pop's use it to slip out 

from under the domination of MSIE. 

Of course I fully intend to post the source code so that 

other third-party developers can take the program further

as the environment changes. 



MicroSoft is trying to hold dominance of the computer world 

through selective release of information. The only way to 

combat this is through transparency, reversing studies and 

the free release of the information they are trying

to withhold. 



I believe I have a right to know which keys in my registry 

are being used so that I can modify them. 



 

Thank you for any help you can give.
