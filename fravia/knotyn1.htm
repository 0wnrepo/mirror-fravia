</HEAD>



<BODY BGCOLOR=#C0C0C0 TEXT=#001010 ALINK=#405040 VLINK=#8850AA>



<P>Hello Fravia+, <BR>

Here is my review list of essays published on your site. The

first attempt included 62 essays, but when I find some time I'll

be updating this html, and sending it to you, please keep it up

to date. I made a template thingy for other 'essay reviewers', so

we can overview the reviews pretty easy. I havent filled in the

'level' thing yet, cause I don't know which levels there are

(adv, beginner, essent. etc). In this format everything is a bit

more visible than in the txt-version I sent you some time ago. <BR>

Knotty Dread</P>

        like <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.t50.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.t50.com/'" tppabs="http://www.t50.com/">www.t50.com</A> (where,

        too, a lot of usefull tools for hacking and cracking can

        be found, I'm not a hacker, but some tools can be nicely

<P>&nbsp; <BR>

I think I've had a very good part of the good essays in the

library because I havent discarded many.The main problem is, that

I havent got a perfect view about the total. I think you should

make a selection of selected essays (the +'es) of everyone that

read a part of the lib, and then make a selection of files using

keywords I gave you, and others hopefully will. keygenerators, by

example (just mentioning something <GR>) then get someone

read all those essays about this subject, and then select the

usefull ones. I'd be happy to cooperate with this, ofcourse. <BR>

I hope you are glad with my work, anyway I've learned some new

things, and having another meg of essays for my personal library.

</P>



<P>Cool Runnings! </P>
