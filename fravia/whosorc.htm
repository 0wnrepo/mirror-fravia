Well: helluya of a work! Even if aZh nAZg'style seems to me a little too convoluted (I hope he'll 

'polish' a little this and detail better, for instance, his stalking on the archies), there's quite 

a lot to learn in here.<bR>This said I actually don't believe (personally) that aZh nAZg's assumptions 

are correct.<br>Yes: "<font color=purple>the trail (is) already long cold and well trampled</FONT>", 

as aZh nAZg writes, yet I remember months of passionate stalking (with the Basilisk, +gthorne and 

Hackmore+Readrite) where we definitely came to the conclusion that +ORC is dutch. Not German, not 

Swede: dutch. And the fact that 

a very well known Amiga cracker of the eighties had as a Nickname 'ORC' gave us much to 

think (but we found few 'beef' on the Web, unfortunately).

<BR>Since +ORC is no more in contact with 

anyone of us, unfortunately, there's no way we can finish our stalking (I remember that when he 

wrote +gthorne that he was in Cairo (Egypt) for his hyerogliphical cracking, more than one year ago, 

I mobilized two egyptian crackers, who went in the CairoMuseum's bar asking if some funny 

european fellow had 

ordered considerable amounts of wodka-martini's... only to find out that no alcohol is 

served there :-(<BR>Yes, +ORC does not publish any more his 'how to crack' 

masterpieces... yet he can still be useful for all reversers 

as 

stalking quarry :-)<BR>I hope, in publishing this essay to open the way for  

some other good stalkers that want to improve their skills joining aZh nAZg 

in this fascinating 

stalking endeavour (a very difficult one now that the trial is cold). 

Good luck.<BR>aZh nAZg's  

Nosferatu stalking is 

an impressive work of art and some of the evidences are quite heavy. Still I don't believe that +ORC is aZh nAZg's Swede: but 

this good swiss stalker may be right with the 

Idea that the tutorial has been translated from Cezch:

my personal alternative theory is that +ORC is the Petr Horýk that wrote in Prag (in 1982!) the 

beautiful utility KGB that you can download on my tools page... Horýk sounds a little 

like +ORC, see, and wasn't +ORC himself that wrote that <U>nomen est omen</U>? :-)

<P>

Who is/was +ORC?  A fine problem; perfect for a weeks

contemplation. 

The Basilisk and others have already done fine work on

bringing the

issue to resolution.  I soon realized that I was

approaching a chase

where the trail was already long cold and well

trampled.  Many

brilliant stalkers had already tried all of the

obvious approaches; 

there was however, some comfort to be had in that, as

that very fact

suggested that +ORC was either being *very* clever, or

*very* candid.

</P>

<P>

While in regular stalking the trick is to have a good

dictionary of

synonyms to feed into the search engines, the trick

with Zen stalking

is to have an open mind ('zen mind'), untiring

doggedness, and above

all, to 'psych' oneself into the mindset of one's

quarry.

</P>

<P>

OK, so, mindset of quarry, now let's see...what do we

know about him?

 The Lessons (read and re-read them all several times,

getting a feel

for the language used), the Riddle itself, the URL and

what it points

to, +ORC's mention of it leading to a 'dead' page...

</P>

<P>

Ok, Riddle:  the language used is heraldic, duh.  The

quote is from,

well you know already, duh.  Some lines are different

than the

original;  there's numeric symbology used, could be

something about

shifting bits, adding, replacing numbers in the URL,

after all, he was

an assembly coder...

</P>

<P>

...nope, he'd be *zen!* too lazy to do that for real. 

He'd want us to

*think* we should do that -- mount an exhaustive

search of the Web --

and sit there revelling that he got all dem lamers up

off their butts

and doing something useful.  But he's got a great

sense of humor, so

mebbe the heraldic stuff is still a clue, jest a diff

sort of clue. 

Save it for lata...

</P>

<P>

The URL, of course leads into .mil territory, as

trcroute will reveal

(actually it winds up bouncing between two DNSs in

.mil until it dies

out).  But as we already know, someone  has visited

fravia using that

URL as their (spoofed) IP address, so we know that

it's someone's

calling card.  How hard is it to do that?  Not very, I

could write the

code from scratch in an hour or so.

</P>

<P>

So, how about the reference to the 'dead' page?  Well,

the obvious

thought is that what that means is a page that's no

longer being

maintained.  I would imagine that many folks have

already searched all

available engines for a +ORC directory, with mixed

results (did you

find the Electric Company, in Minsk?).  But, I hand

you +ORC's *own

words*: (Lesson 2: '...for those of you that do not

know anything,

here is the ARCHIE way you get all the program that do

EXIST on the

planet:...').  My favorite one is the one in

Oldenburg, Germany

(<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://marvin.physik.uni/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://marvin.physik.uni/'" tppabs="http://marvin.physik.uni/">-oldenburg.de/Docs/net-serv/archie-gate.html</A>).  

Let's see...orc.htm...there it

is: www.sics.se/sicskatalog/orc/orc.htm, and hey! orc.gif as well. 

Let's see who this is...

</P>

<P>

Ok, its Lars-Hakan Loenn ... and what's this, his

nickname? 'Orc' ...

well, well ... what does he do...search, search...a

hah!  He was a

student at SU (university of Sweden) in 93, and in 94,

and...hmm, not

in 95...where was he in 95...search, search...a Hah! 

He's at CalTech,

in the Swedish Club.  And he didn't graduate...so he

was an exchange

student ... search, search ... he's into RPG (role

playing games),

specifically Gothic ... search, search ... while at

CalTech lists his

home server as <FONT color=blue>nosferatu.sics.se</FONT> ... search, search

... lot's of references to Gothic RPG.  Save that for later...

</P>

<P>

Ok, orc.htm -- view source -- nothing interesting

here.  Spider

sics.se ... search, search ... ok: Swedish Institute

of Computer

Science ... phone number, building name, a Hah! group

name ... search,

search ... here it is: his name on several of SICS's

web pages as

'Grafik: Loenn'.  He's a webmaster.  He likes

graphics.  He might

think heraldry is kewl, gothic and all that.  Hmm.

</P>

<P>

Search, search ... a hah!  He's does marathon runs:

3000m and 5000m,

aka OL, which pardon my german means Orientierungs

Lauf or some such,

just as though he were in the militia at the time ...

c.f. 'possibly

once in the military' reference (forget where, duh). 

Ok, so he knows

about encryption, and that .mil servers are off

limits.  Hmm.

</P>

<P>

Ok, dejanews da sucka ... advanced search, 1 Dec 95

thru 1 Jun 96

author +ORC ... whaz dis?  16 Feb 96 : 'see if it

works' by +ORC

posted to alt.test ... see if *what* works? ... where

else doth he

post?  Ok, alt.hacker.malicious, makes sense, but,

what's this:

de.org.ccc? whazzat?  Ok, hmm, they're talking about

Germany's PTT

trying to regulate Inet access.  Why Germany?  He's

Swedish ... hmm,

mebbe he wants to go work in Germany when he's done

with school. 

Means he must speak fluent German, at the very least

... his English

ain't lousy either ... could have a Dutch parent or

spend time there

on vacation or mebbe grew up there ... when's the

first Lesson?  20

Feb 96 thru 25 Jun 96 ... and what's this? he keeps on

re-posting

stuff - wierd! (tell ye why in a moment, hehe)

</P>

<P>

Now, dear reader, for some major Zen.  Forgive me

while I quote

verbatim a rather lengthy chunk of news thread.  You

will benefit from

reading it in its entirety b4 getting to my commentary

you can check it out for yourself on dejanews): Posted

Don't forget.  the mentality of the poster should be

taken into

account.  No

real hacker is going to post something like "Trace

me!".  Only someone

that

wants to show off to their friends.  So we have it

generally limited to

"netcom.com", "ix.netcom.com", "aol.com", "gnn.com",

"cris.com" (This

is a

generalization of course).<BR>



Next we look at the "PATH:" which is completely

useless. as is NNTP

posting host field.  So we turn to more unorthodoxed

methods.  His

sig. . .<BR>



He put "BORG" in his sig well that is a helper.  We go

to one of many

online

"411" type services and search for "borg" starting

with the entire

internet.  If that brought too many people then we

look at the survers

listed above.  But since this left approximately 4

entries from the

entire internet we convert the e-mail address to visit

their

homepages. . .<BR>



We then look at the home pages to see who has the

mentality AND the

expertise to use an anon remailer and to broadcast

that they are using

one.  This brings it down to one person. <BR>



NOTE:  The method above is not exactly tracing but

hey, it works 99.9%

of the time.  And usually works against the anon

remailer posters.<BR>



Should I post his location so you people can shut up

about this?<BR>



he is at "ix.netcom.com"<BR>



I can post his entire e-mail address, but I don't

think he would like

getting

requests about how he did it.<BR>



I KNOW HOW TO TRACE!  SO SHUT UP about the above

method!<BR>



Can I assume that "iceonline.com" is a remailer?  I

will have to check

my list

of remailers.  Need to find my list first though.  Oh,

well the method

above

works even if the person didn't use an anon

remailer.<BR>

Why should I hide my domain?  I am doing nothing

illegal.<BR>



NewBies, to find information go to:<BR>

        pubweb.nexor.co.uk/public/cusi/cusi.html<BR>

pick a search engine, preferably Lycos<BR>

and use common sense in the key words.<BR>

Are you still there?  Did you survive that?  So, what

do you think --

is +ORC more like 'BORG', or is he more like 'The

Analyst'?  To my

taste, he's more like BORG.  Why do a test in

alt.test, IF HE KNOWS

HOW TO HACK??  Why keep re-posting to news, rather

than e-mail ppl

direct?  Why publish at all?  Why publish EVERYTHING

in just 4 months?

 I don't think we're looking at a 'leet hacker here. 

I think the guy

that posted the Lessons was an amateur, that he found

them somewhere

and decided to post, and that he had a 'socialist'

agenda regarding

'for profit' and distribution of goods. (Well, Sweden

*is* socialist,

after all).  So, let's redefine the problem:  are we

looking for Able,

that wrote the Lessons, or Baker that published them?

</P>

<P>

Now, I speak fluent English, German and French, and

can read pages

written in Dutch, Swedish, Italian, Spanish and pig

latin ( comes from

having been in prep in Switzerland; veni vidi vici et

al).  Those

Lessons read like a translation to English from

(possibly) German, or

even maybe Czech.  My guess is, +ORC found the Lessons

on fido, or in

eastern europe, and translated them, or mebbe got them

via CalTech

while he was studying there.  I did a quick scan of

all threads in

alt.hacker.malicious during the end of 95 and early

96, to see who if

any stopped posting once +ORC started.  There are

several; take your

pick.  It t'ain't Destrukto cuz  Destrukto still

operates a site today

as Destrukto.  Noone on aol.com's a good bet, c.f. 'The

Analyst' s comments above :).  Btw, nfo.org is 'National Farmers

Organisation", hehe.

</P>

<P>

Assuming this zen reasoning is correct (and i have no

good reason to

doubt my own intuition, hehe), we will probably

*never* find out who

authored the Lessons, unless we can find them

somewhere with file

dates prior to Feb 96.  But I have great hopes of

finding +ORC

himself.  For I know, he's into Gothic, and Graphics. 

Search, search

... here it is:

</P>

<P>

Nosferatu himself:

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Stadium/9490/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Stadium/9490/'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Stadium/9490/" target=_blank>http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Stadium/9490</A>. 

In his email he speaks of further riddles, so let's

see.  We know they

won't be 'leet, or on par with the Lessons (was he too

lazy to answer,

or just didn't know?), so they shouldn't be too hard

to crack ... :)

</P>

<P>

Ok, on index.htm:<BR>

- '...and sword-shaped toothpicks from a dry

martini...'<BR>

- 'Last, and most importantly for the purposes of this

site:  The

nosferatu are potent information-    gatherers,

managing to gain

access to just about everything.'<BR>

- 'all is not as it appears'<BR>

Sounds like the +ORC we know and love, no?  Hmm. 

Here, the page owner

is soliciting help from ne1 who knows some javascript.

 Guess +ORC

decided to 'help' out a bit, no?  And put some

Orc-isms in while he

was at it.

</P>

<P>

Did you find the 'secret' door yet?  I knew you would

:).  Here is the

passage:  'So, you think your a good nosferatu just

because you found

the secret 'door'... Anyone with half a brain could

have figured that

out. OK, so you're bright enough to know that not

everything is as it

appears. Good for you.'<BR>

That 'good for you' is straight out of the Lessons, is

it not?  Which

it would be if +ORC had translated them, for they

would then be in his

idiom of choice.  Things are still making sense. 

Ooooh!  Heres a

Login script!  Oh no!  It's booby trapped!  Re:<BR>

<BR>

"Also for reference, this is impossible for mortals to

hack.  If they

do successfully hack it, the site shuts down for a

week and changes

are made to prevent it from happening again.  Also, it

will mess with

their computer so much that they couldn't hack it

again if they wanted

to.  It uploads a virus to any computer that attempts

to access it. 

The virus allows complete access to all files on that

persons

computer.  It downloads all of their files to the

creator of the site,

right before it deletes al of them and even destroys

their hardware. 

Only registered nosferatu have the anti-virus program.

 It is highly

unlikely that anyone could program an adequate

anti-virus program

becaus hidden with the first virus (if it is disabled)

then a second

virus will activate and just erase all of their files

(starting with

their anti-virus). The masquerade is perfectly

protected."<BR>

Gee, that's one major protection scheme he's got goin'!  

So, just for the exercise, log in as admin, and create a user with

nicely high access privileges (ye can figger out what the letter

codes are, sure ye can!), and go view that nice rumor database!  Piece

of cake.

</P>

<P>

Paranoia sets in.  What if +ORC really *is* an elite 

cracker?  What if that page is merely a smokescreen, and there are other

pages hidden on that site?  What if i'm wrong?  Go figure :-)
