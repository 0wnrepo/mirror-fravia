MDK 3DFX EXECUTABLE PATCHED TO REMOVE THE CD CHECK - MORE DOS4GW STUFF

 

URL HTTP://WWW.3DFX.COM/FILES/PATCHES/MDK3DFX.ZIP also at WWW.SHINY.COM

 

More & more, 3DFX & its variants are fast becoming the 'de-facto' for any 

serious gamers. When you experience the sheer quality & frame rate improvements 

first-hand it's almost a let down to play a non-accelerated game again.

 

This is all well & good but by its very nature, the disk-intensiveness of many

modern games can cause real problems when you add the 'stupid' CD check routine 

- ranging from "Please insert the XXXXX CD in drive X" messages regardless of 

whether it's there or not, failures to play red-book audio to a complete game-crash 

or system lock-up. (Carmageddon is one such example).

 

It is therefore in the spirit of "getting the thing to run the way it should" 

as much as the spin-off benefit of a CD-less gameplay, that I submit this little 

tutorial & would also suggest that a section be started - dedicated to 3DFX 

cracking!

 

So, to work then.

 

Well, call me a plagurist or whatever, but for this little crack I used nothing

more than:

 

DOS's File Compare

Yamato's published essay from +ORC's lesson about DOS4GW CD cracking.

An old MDK Win95 exe file already patched to remove the CD check.

Hedit v2.00 (OK, but I'm used to it!)

W32Dasm 8.7 (cracked to my liking of course!)

 

Having read the essay I had an idea of what was going on with this protection

(that +ORC is an amazing guy, how does he work out all this cram?), so I decided

to dissasemble the cracked exe & compare it to the original just to see it for 

myself. 

Sure enough, just as the man said, there was a compare followed by the setting 

of a flag of doom with an optional jump to freedom. Now the sneaky part, 3DFX 

exe's are structurally quite similar to native Win95 exe's - ie: both utilise 

DirectX & D3D etc. 

With this in mind I decided to dissasemble the MDK3DFX.EXE file that I had 

downloaded from 3DFX.COM earlier in the day. Again, sure enough, there were 

many similarities including data object strings etc. To cut a long story short 

all I did was to track down the protection routine by comparing the data & string 

positions between the Win95 executable & the 3DFX executable. Having narrowed 

it down I simply traced the dead-listing back to the point where the check began 

& ensured that (with as little code alteration as possible vis-a-vis +ORC's 

advice) it followd a route avoiding the dreaded "BADEXE" string - you can imagine 

what that means eh?

 

Anyway, below is a small excerpt from the 'CD cracked Win95 exe' followed by 

the dead-listing to crack the 3DFX target.

Obviously, if you people out there don't have a 3DFX card you can still use this 

to patch the win95 exe.

Well, there you go, patch away & enjoy! They say neccessity is the mother 

of invention & I reckon I saved about 4 hours on a possibly fruitless 

net-search for a 'ready-made' crack.

Note for Fravia:

 

If you feel this is NOT worthy for project 4, maybe +Gthorne can use it?

 

I previously submitted the 3D Game Menu newbie tutorial, you said you'd passed it on

but I didn't see it?
