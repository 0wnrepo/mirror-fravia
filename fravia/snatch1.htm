<HR><I>Well... this happens ofter and ofter nowadays: I was preparing my 

own 

&quot;An interesting tool: Numega's Smartcheck 5.0&quot; essay... and Snatch has &quot;snatched&quot;  

it before me.<BR>

Well, the minimum that Snatch can do after having spoiled my &quot;in fieri&quot; essay :-) is to allow me a somehow long introduction to 

his essay: here it is.<BR><BR>

Smartcheck is an interesting tool indeed... yet you must be careful 

and set it up corrrectly: 

</I></CENTER>program/settings: Default: detect and report everything

<BR>program/settings/advanced: check everything, don't suppress anything

<CENTER><I>and don't forget to </I>&quot;check program compliance&quot;<I> before 

delving in... as soon as you use it you'll easily understand that this program is a very important 

addition to our tools arsenal.<BR><BR>In fact the real funny question is: &quot;Why does Numega use such stupid protections?&quot;.

Mind you, we are not speaking of a small shareware programmer that is using 

some overbloated language for some overbloated useless application: we are speaking 

of the BEST programmers and wizards of assembly in the whole planet here!<BR>

<BR>

The fact that Numega (which, differently 

from 

Micro$oft lamers' park, HAS INDEED A LOT of said good programmers and 

wizards) publishes powerful disassembly and reversing tools (Bondcheck, 

Smartcheck, Softice...) in  

downlodable &quot;trial&quot; version with 

pretty silly protections (as if the kind of people that REALLY USE such tools 

were not capable of earing a password echo in memory) can IMO only mean 

two things:<BR><BR>

A) EITHER Numega follows the Micro$oft path of giving away everything 

for free, in the hope that they will dominate the disassembler 

&quot;commercial&quot; 

markt and get the rewards from &quot;scale&quot; economy.<BR>

This may happen: it is clear that the crackers and &quot;simple&quot; programmers 

of to-day, 

i.e. a great part of the people that peruse the many available sites like mine, ARE the reverse 

engineers of to-morrow (who else?), and will be able to afford *any*   

&quot;commercial&quot; fare that Numega will in the future decide for, say, 

Smartcheck version 13.0.<BR>

B) OR that Numega will bring to light a very tough protections (the mytical 

&quot;unbreakable&quot; software protection :-) as soon as their absolute dominance 

of the market has been asserted. Let's hope they do it soon: the &quot;protections&quot;

 (if you really want to call them so) that they 

are using at the moment are simply too boring to bother<BR><BR>

And here is the short essay by Snatch, sorry for the long introduction</I></CENTER><HR size="6"><PRE>

Cracking Numega Smartcheck 5.0

by Snatch</CENTER></FONT>



I was recently tipped off that Numega's Smartcheck could 

reverse visual basic files so I downloaded the demo from 

this site:

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('ftp://ftp.ultranet.com/pub0/n/numega/files/smchk50.exe  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='ftp://ftp.ultranet.com/pub0/n/numega/files/smchk50.exe'" tppabs="ftp://ftp.ultranet.com/pub0/n/numega/files/smchk50.exe">ftp://ftp.ultranet.com/pub0/n/numega/files/smchk50.exe</A> (about 7.19 megs)

The first thing I noticed when I ran the setup file was a 

password to start the setup program.  

So I went into Softice ver 3.21(very nice indeed), and set a bpx 

getwindowtext.  Then type in a dummy password and click OK. 

After stepping through the routine(F10), you find that there is:



CALL USER!GETWINDOWTEXT &gt;&gt; Get what you typed

LEA AX,[BP-32] &gt;&gt; Load AX with address of what you typed

PUSH SS &gt;&gt; Segment of what you typed

PUSH AX &gt;&gt; Offset of what you typed

PUSH DS &gt;&gt; Segment of real password

PUSH 06BA &gt;&gt; Offset of real password

CALL USER!LSTRCMP &gt;&gt;Comparison of strings at ss:ax and ds:09d6



Next you do a dump of 06ba:

d ds:06ba l 64



You should see the password, &amp;Smc50-14d% there in front of your eyes.  

Type bd * to disable your breakpoints, ctl-d to run and get an error, 

and then run the setup again and type the right password to bypass 

that silly message.

Now we are one-fourth of the way done!  It was that easy!

After going through a few screens, you will see your name, company plus 

a serial number!  I tried to crack the serial number but gave up.  

Don't worry, we can still crack this later on, and much easier and 

quicker.  So simply install it.  And run it :-)

Now load a program (must be 32-bit which is why this program won't 

help me too much with vb programs).  Now try program and start.  

Uh-Oh!  Name of thr trial user, blue &quot;trial meter&quot; and registration 

number.  

Phew!, there is a purchase button.  Let's click it.  Here it is, 

unlock code and all.  Nice, lets go back to the debugger.  

be * for our breakpoints to be re-enabled.  

Now enter your name and company and a dummy password.  

BOOM!  your in the debugger.  Now step and step and step and step 

until you get to a patch of code that looks like this:



ADD ESP,04

LEA EAX,[EBP-14] &gt;&gt; Your password

LEA ECX,[EBP-28] &gt;&gt; The correct password

PUSH EAX &gt;&gt; Your password

PUSH ECX &gt;&gt; The correct password

CALL 10005680



Here you have it!  Type a <FONT color="blue">d ecx l 64</FONT>, and the first 16 bytes are 

the right code.  

Numega is using a hashing of your name and password and reg number 

to get the code so for everyone the code will be different.  

Now back to reality, write down those 16 numbers and disable 

your breakpoints, 

bd *, 

now ctl-d.  

Keep your name and company the same, enter the password in and you 

are a *registered* user of numega smartcheck 5.0, with your own user 

name and password!



**Note, you could have probably reversed this protection scheme, 

also, individuating both passwords I have described by editing the 

memory and changing the jumps to noop's but I &quot;trust more&quot; the real 

and correct password!
