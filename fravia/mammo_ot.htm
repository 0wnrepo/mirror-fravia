So far I have been working on two aspects of this project: 

existing API monitors, and VXD writing.



Existing API Monitors

---------------------



In addition to APIMON.EXE. which is more of a debugger and is only 

reliable (if even) in NT, I have found the following three API monitor 

apps:





*API Vision

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/apivis/avdemo15.exe  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/apivis/avdemo15.exe'" tppabs="ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/apivis/avdemo15.exe">ftp://ftp.rahul.net/pub/apivis/avdemo15.exe</A>

This is the best, and the one I highly recommend. The above url links to 

a 15-day demo that I have not taken the time to crack, but will 

definitely do now that I have evaulated the program (it should be a 

standard time check, no need for an essay). The program is excellent, 

although the available api calls are of course limited. The UI is 

fantastic, and even has a &quot;hook next task&quot; feature. Output shows API 

function name, parameters, and returns.

The monitor is implemented with a static-load VXD that is initialized in 

system.ini--vxd name is vicept.386. There are also numerous &quot;grabber&quot; 

DLLs that handle the function parameters calls for each API module.



Note that the use of a VXD is not required for this type of utility; the 

next two apps use dlls for their monitoring. However, if we are to 

intercept API calls and change their parameters, I think a VXD would be 

recommended.





*EXESpy

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.spywindows.com/ZIPS/EXESPY98.ZIP  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.spywindows.com/ZIPS/EXESPY98.ZIP'" tppabs="http://www.spywindows.com/ZIPS/EXESPY98.ZIP">http://www.spywindows.com/ZIPS/EXESPY98.ZIP</A>

This is the worst of the lot, an ugly VB-style UI. Uses funhk.dll to 

capture API calls and prints them to a window and log file. By the guys 

who did ComSpy.





*Trace Plus Win32

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('ftp://ftp.sstinc.com/pub/tplus32.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='ftp://ftp.sstinc.com/pub/tplus32.zip'" tppabs="ftp://ftp.sstinc.com/pub/tplus32.zip">ftp://ftp.sstinc.com/pub/tplus32.zip</A>

Not a bad program, but I like API Vision better. This one relies on DLLs 

as well and is quite well done, but has useless windows like a &quot;system 

log&quot; and seems to slow the process down. Regarding the monitoring 

technology, the following is from the readme:



&quot;32 bit versions of TracePlus use the standard Microsoft 

defined debugging interface for Win32 applications. The 

Microsoft interface does not permit detaching from a process 

after debugging has started. Therefore, if TracePlus is 

terminated, it will also terminate all processes being traced.&quot;









In addition, I have found a copy of API Spy for Win16 (does not run in 

95) and have come across references to a Win32 version...written in VB, 

so once again VXD programming is not a must. There is also a program in 

development--I think at spywindows--called API Insight.





Writing a VxD

-------------



After a bit of study and comparing DDK examples against the literature, 

it appears that writing a VxD really is not that difficult 

(comparatively speaking, of course). Basically you create an ASM program 

to handle the Virtual Device Declaration and the VXD Locked Code/Data 

segments (which contain the control procedure, a message handler for 

VxDs)--you can code the rest in C quite easily (it's all structures and 

macros). If you add a pseudo-api by using DeviceIoControl calls--which 

contain as a parameter the name of the vxd function to be called--in the 

application that communicates with the VxD, you will have a Ring-3 

application that calls functions in the Ring-0 VxD; the whole 

implementation is basically a combination of CreateFile (to open the 

VxD) and DeviceIoControl calls. (The VxD contains a function named 

OnDeviceIoControl or somesuch which is called by the control process [in 

the .asm file, remember] in response the DeviceIoControl messages...the 

OnDeviceIoControl function is a second message handler--a switch 

statement in C--that then calls the internal vxd functions, like so:

</PRE><XMP>

;application.c

hVXD = CreateFile(&quot;\\\\.\\name.vxd&quot;,0,0,0,CREATE_NEW, 

FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE, 0);

DeviceIoControl(hVXD, FUNCTION_NAME, descriptor, sizeof(descriptor));



;vxd.asm

VxD_LOCKED_CODE_SEG

BeginProc ControlProc

	Control_Dispatch W32DEVICEIOCONTROL, _OnDeviceIoCtrl, cCall, <ESI>

	clc

	ret

EndProc ControlProc

VxD_LOCKED_CODE_ENDS



;vxd.c

DWORD _OnDeviceIoCtrl(PDIOCPARAMETERS param){

	switch (param-&gt;dwIoControlCode)  ;this struc member is the function 

name

	{

		case API_Hook_Task:

			_APIHookTask(....);

			return 0;

		case API_Patch_Call:

			_APIPatch();

			return 0;

		default:

			return 1;

	}

}</XMP><PRE>

The hard part, then, is not creating a VxD with an API--and using this 

method you do not have to register with M$oft for a VxD API ID# ;) The 

hard part will be intercepting these damn API calls instead of just 

watching them.



Oh yeah, notice that this is a dynamically-loaded VxD (the CreateFile() 

call)...I'm sure none of us want extra junk floating around in memory. 

BTW, there is a registry key at

\HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\VxD

that contains VxDs to be loaded at startup _in_addition_to system.ini 

and the RunServices key.



That's all for now, I'll update you later in the week when I start 

taking apart Api Vision. What my &quot;specifications&quot; are for this prog is 

to intercept calls made to any exported function in a Dll (even non-API 

ones), which will require a different approach than these monitors have 

been using...they seem to be using static DBases of API functions.



later,
