<CENTER><FONT size=+2>Fastraq Post Server; a "best before" protection scheme

by Cybercurve</FONT></CENTER><BR>

Here's a small essay written by a newbie and for newbies.



Protection type : 'best before'

There are some things (e.g. crossreferences) that make it look

like it's protected against cracking, but if that is so, it's a very

stupid way to protect a program: This program is cracked by only changing

4 bytes.



I cracked this and I've written an essay on how i did it. I'm a newbie, 

so I can't be sure it works, but i've tried to start it up with the computer 

clock set to many different dates, and used it a few times after i cracked it 

and it does seem to work. (of course with a invalid reg-code)



----- here starts the essay (a big word for this small piece of text) -------



Cracking FastRaq Postserver.



Target: 

Fastraq Post Server (version 0.7.5.20, post.exe = 2.336.768 bytes)

	Download from: http://www.fastraq.demon.co.uk/post	

Tools used:	

Wdasm 8.9 (free demo version will do)

	Download from: http://www.expage.com/page/w32dasm

Ultraedit (free demo version will do, any decent hexeditor will do)

	Download from: http://www.download.com.



NOTE: all numbers are hexadecimal



I'm in quit a busy period now, so cracking this program took

a few weeks, but I only worked a few hours on it, and believe

you can do it faster, but i started to try to crack this using

softice, which took a lot of time but got me nowhere (that's

propably my fault, certainly not softice's).



This is a very nice program to learn cracking on because they

give away free temporary-registration codes that expire in one

month. So there's no real need to crack this program, but that's

not the point. The point is that they tried to do some protection

(at least that's what i think it is), but as you will see, any newbie

cracker (like me) should be able to crack this without any problem,

and within two hours.



Let's start the work:



I tried to set breakpoints using Softice, but that got me nowhere.

If you installed the program and entered a temporay-registration code,

exit fastraq, start regedit.exe, search for the reg-code. You

should land in : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Fastraq\Post Server\0.93

Change the serial so it is invalid.

copy post.exe to post.wdm.

open post.wdm in wDasm.



Start Fastraq, it shows a messagebox "Register the Post Server"

containing "Please enter your registration number."

Goto Wdasm click on 'Refs'/'String data references' and scroll to

"Please enter your registration" Double click. Double click again.

There's only one location in the program where it appears (535EE1 

which is offset 1352E1 in post.exe). Question is, how does the program

get there? answer, look a few lines above, it comes there by a 

CONDITIONAL(could it be easier ?)-jump from 535FBF. go to there.

it says :

:00535FBF 0F8709FFFFFF ja 00535ECE

and it is offset 1353BF in post.wdm

Open post.exe in a hexeditor. goto 1353BF and change 0F87 into EB04.

(+Orc says that you shouldn't NOP some code out, and I advice you 

to use this simple 'jump ahead' solution to avoid nop's) and save.



Start Post.exe. It says "The evaluation period for this.." 

goto wDasm, do a string-reference search on that. you should

find the following two locations : 535427 and 53545C. on both locations

look a few lines above you should see something like:

	fcomp qword ptr [0057CDB0] <DO some difficult things

	fstsw ax

	sahf 

	jbe 0053543B <-- conditional-jump away



So, that's how we escape the message. Open post.exe in hexeditor,

goto offset 13481A change 761F (jbe) into EB1F (always jump).

goto offset 13484F change 7615 (jbe) into EB15 (always jump).



Start Post.exe again. click on help/about. it something like:

Product expiry : -84 days.

How nice, cogito ergo sum fatigatus. (as Descartes said)



That seems to be it. In many essays the Authors give the impression 

to be perfect, and never mentions the mistakes that they have almost 

surely made, well i did make some:



-I first concentrated on getting the help/about to always show a normal 

number so that it would never expire, i landed in the code "which.class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/which.class" 

calculates the number of days left, and found that there's some 

protection that does a lot of call-ing / ret-ing at the end of the 

function to make it difficult to change the result of the function,

which is stored in (surprise) AX. It could be bypassed i think, but 

haven't tried this since it is not necessary. 

I removed some messages like ('registration number is invalid) but didn't 

get any further.

I didn't have a wodka-martini, and i had to do some other work so when i 

started to look at the program again i thought 'well, why should i care 

about the about-box? I only need to get the program start up. Then i did 

the work described above in less than half an hour, which is a reasonable

time for a newbie.



Well, otium esse melior est non facere, so that's it for now.
