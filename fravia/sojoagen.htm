Well, I'm sure the nice people at Macromedia will enjoy reading this. Leaving that info on the splash screen 
is what lawyers would call a &quot;<u>culpa in vigilando</u>&quot;, and protectors should 
take duly note of this aspect.<br>I just wonder, Sojourner, if it would not be worth to investigate 
a little more WHY the target refuses older editions of the <font color="blue">rsagnt32.dll</font>. I mean, would 
it not be interesting to compel this kind of targets to run 
on an older (and already fully reversed) copy of the rsagnt32.dll? In fact: I subscribe 
100% to Sojourner's assertion: &quot;<font color="blue">We make a program do what we want, 
eventually that is, as soon as 
we find out
what it really does want</font>&quot;. That's exactly what reversers do, &quot;<u>cognitio rei per causas</u>&quot;, if 
you allow me to
use two latin sentences in the same introduction :-)<br>Enjoy!

Everything I have learned on software reversing has been because this web site exists and
provides needed info to wouldbe reversers.
Things change, and we need to be alert and change as well, especially when the software companies
change
their methods. I'm grateful to all essays' writers and to +Orc, Fravia+ for all they have done
and continue to do in
the name of education and freedom. Please read over the whole essay first before
really &quot;doing&quot; anything because
sometimes I am going back and inserting snippets I may have initially forgotten to mention,
 and these may not necessarily
be in the exact location where they should be.

I love Macromedia products and appreciate them providing their software over the net for anyone
who may want
it. Usually, you can download a fully working trial that has a 30 day limit. Pretty good deal,
huh?
I mentioned above that this session was not that easy for me and the reason was because after I
had downloaded
the Flash 4 and installed it under Win98 I received an error message and the program wouldn't
start.
<br><br>
Eventually I installed it under WinNT 4.0 and was able to get it running properly. Now the juicy
part begins.
<br><br>
Go ahead and run the Flash 4 prog. If your installation was successful you'll get the Macromedia
splash screen
for Flash 4 and it will say that you have 30 days left on your trial. Now the prog will not
advance until you
you make a choice. On the right hand side of the splash screen you will have the opportunity to
either Try the
prog or even Buy it.
<br><br>
Go ahead and choose the Buy option and you will get to a screen that will take all kinds of info
from you.
I went ahead and used a credit card for the purchase and was sure that I was not connected to 
the
Web. I just
don't trust them, and my modem has the sound turned off, so I wouldn't know otherwise. Okay,
sometime in the
future I will go ahead and find a solution for all those who have no credit cards, 
but not today.<br><br>Oh, yes,
before I forget:
Make sure you write down the serial number that Macromedia gives you at the
bottom of that
initial splash screen. You'll need it later after you &quot;buy&quot; the prog 
and it unfolds to
the full version. Also,
thank Macromedia for being so generous with that very important number. Have you 
written it down?
If you don't,
you'll find that the number will disappear after you have bought the prog and that will take some
time to
recover, believe me. Yes, you probably could reinstall it, but I don't know for sure. Why take
the chance?<br>
 1. Now, you need to disassemble both Flash 4 and the rsagnt32.dll located within Flash's
directory. You should
notice that there are 2 important Flash references in the directory where it is installed,
Flash.exe and
<a name="earlier"></a>Flash.dl_, which eventually becomes the full executible.
Just disassemble the small 252 kb flash.exe at this time. 
<br><br>
I also looked into the progs with Borland Resource Workshop and did not find any references to
strings that I
needed. Now this was after I had looked into the guts of the progs from within W32DASM 8.9. Of
course, there
were many strings, but nothing helpful. So where's the code, already? Just hang onto your
underwear. A
thoughtful preamble can save you alot of online time friend.<br>Remember +ORC's old lessons- we
need to use our
most important asset carefully- our brain.<br>
Did you go ahead and &quot;buy&quot; your program yet? You have probably seen that after you have
printed out your
receipt you can now go in and place your &quot;unlock&quot; code in the little space where it
asks you for it. What you
don't have an unlock code? Whatever was I thinking about? Did you get any messages when you input
the wrong
code? Did you even put in a fake unlock code? Come on. This is a learning experience. Put
something in. I
actually know the correct code, BUT, I didn't until I went into my search mode. You may be able
to discover it
as well, but it really doesn't matter. We make the program do what we want, 
eventually that is, when
we find out
what it really does want.<br>So let's fire up W32DASM and load the disassembled flash.exe and run
the prog.
Again, we're back at the same start up screen I mentioned early on. Since you've already
&quot;bought&quot; the prog,
we still have to &quot;unlock&quot; it now without further adieu.<br>Please go ahead and input some
number in the &quot;unlock&quot;
space provided and then push the &quot;enter&quot; key. You will see a little box come up and
give you an error
message - unless you hit the nail on the head first time... highly unlikely, my friend.<br>
<br>
Remember, we're still in the Flash prog and there is nothing that is discernible that says
otherwise. At this
point, what would you do? Yes, go ahead and think about this for a minute while I go download
some code for you
to see.----------------------<br><br>
That didn't take too long did it? Well, what did you come up with? Don't be shy. It's just you
and me.
Hopefully, I've already given you a big hint at the very beginning and you know we're delving
into the
rsagnt32.dll, and not really the Flash prog, even though, you'll end up with it anyway. You could
not get the
Flash prog without doing this other more important work. Since I have a good history with the
rsagnt32.dll, I
knew I had to load it up which I did. So go ahead and load the .dll to the running program. Just
double click
on it in the .dll window and it will ask you if you want to load the .dll- say yes. Now, the
Flash will
apparently be gone and replaced with the rsagnt32.dll.<br><br>
<font size="+3">rsagnt32.dll</font><br>

We are where we need to be to actually
start this
lesson. If you haven't already done so, take some time to peruse the string listing. You really
won't find much
of any help here anymore. Yes, I say anymore, because the old rsagnt32.dll is no more- literally.
<br>This newer
.dll is much more clever than its predecessor. In the old .dll you could find gobs of useful
string references
which made the earlier .dll very easy to work around compared to its modern brother. I couldn't
even cheat and
put in the old .dll because the Flash prog recognized the difference and strictly refused to run.
<br>So, what did you come up with? What do we do next? A couple of things come to mind. We might set
a breakpoint
for DialogBoxParamA, but we're already at the dialog box. Maybe we could set to
User32.GetDlgItemTextA as we
below. I actually set to break on any User32.MessageBoxA and this is the <a href="#first">first</a> that W32DASM caught<br>

As you can see, There just aren't a whole lot of words wasted here. So the question is, &quot;Now
that I'm here,
What do I do?&quot; It may have too late for you to catch what went on while you were arriving at
this location.
I mean, if you push the &quot;Run&quot; button in W32DASM, why you're just here. What I suggest
you do this go round,
since we can do this as often as you like without penalty here, is to set the code window to
accept API's
and then walk through the code watching the window as it changes and you will eventually see a
watch window
pop up that shows the MessageBoxA and <a href="#it"><font color="#FF0000">what is in
it</font></a>. What is in it is a nasty message, &quot;Invalid Unlocking
Code.&quot; The problem for us is, we can't see it just by looking at the code ourselves, not
until after the
fact. Okay, logically, you may presume as I did, that I'll just look close by and see if I can't
jump that
bugger and that is exactly what I did. As you'll see, just above the MessageBoxA function about
15 lines,
you'll see this type of<font color="#800000"> <a href="#jump">jump</a></font>. You can go ahead
and change this to EB51 which forces it to jump over this junk.
Now run it again and what do you get? &quot;Invalid Unlocking Code&quot; of course. Who said all
of this would be easy?<br>
So apparently we didn't solve the dilemma. But why? We jumped over this lousy MessageBoxA. Go
back and examine
the cmp directly in front of the je at <a href="#cmp1">100059FF</a>. Do you remember that I said
to put any number you wanted to
in the &quot;Unlock&quot; box? This compare checks that. You can see for yourself if you'll put a
quick breakpoint at
10005A02 and run the prog again. Now check ecx, and depending on how many numbers you've typed in
you'll see a
corresponding hex code to that effect. I checked this a couple of times myself to be sure of
this. So, if you
have typed exactly 10 single-digit numbers you will easily jump this part without changing any
code whatsoever.<br>
This is great! But we still have the &quot;Invalid Unlock Code&quot; message.
<br><br>
What we need to do now is follow the jump from 10005A02 to 10005A55. Allow me to go get some more
code for
you to see.<br>

At 10005AAB you'll see another <a href="#jne1">jne</a>. If you set a breakpoint here you'll see
that you may be thrown to that area
which is another MessageBoxA with a bad message (push 1004220C). BUT- if we inc eax, dec eax
(40,48) all the
way through the code at 10005AAB, it will allow us to slide on down to 10005AD6 with another jne.
<br>Set a
breakpoint here and run the prog again. Be sure you either have changed the previous je at
10005A02 or put in
the correct number of integers (10). Now Force the jne at 10005AD6 to a jump (EB4B)and single
step to <a href="#push"><font color="#FF0000">10005B2D</font></a>
and you'll see the name you entered earlier on. Notice also that we are being set up for another
MessageBoxA
just a few lines further down, and also notice that that rotten message &quot;Invalid Unlocking
Code&quot; does not
appear in the pushes this time. Actually we're almost home now.<br><br>I've purposely left out the
serial number that
this program requires to finish unlocking the Flash 4 fully. There are actually 2 that it will
accept and they
are in plain view in the string listing for the rsagnt32.dll. After you get the correct serial
number input
and press enter, you will get a message saying that the program is being set up for use. 
Remember
<a href="#earlier">earlier</a> I
 said that there were 2 references to Flash that were important? Well, this is where things
change and the very
small executible Flash (253kb) is erased to be replaced by a much larger executible Flash. &quot;So?&quot;,
you may say.<br>The
reason is, W32DASM ceases to work with this prog you were running because it doesn't exist anymore.
Just quit and
shut down W32DASM and open your new Flash 4 and put in the Macromedia serial number required to
run it. Hope you
wrote it down like I mentioned earlier. I would recommend keeping this rsagnt32.dll somewhere
safe because if
you download any new Macromedia stuff you'll surely run into it again and there's no sense
inventing the wheel
again. Right?<br>
