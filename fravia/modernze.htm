<I>Well, read it</I></CENTER><HR><PRE>

Dear fravia+, dear +gthorne, dear +sync,



	Ok, here I am, back from a very long (and interesting) journey... and

 I'm very happy with what I see (I was almost netless): the cracking

 landscape has changed!

	The quality (and the quantity) of the essays that you have made and

 published is astonishing... I have myself never received so much input in

 my life! Your &quot;unit&quot; is the only one that survived from the 1996 &quot;levy&quot;,

 and I'm happy to say that you went beyond all my expectations. 

	So I'm happy :=) Very happy :=D



	I would say that, should I ever have had a role as cracking teacher,

 this role is over now, thanks god.



	You three (and many of the new crackers) have already gained a

 remarkable level of competence, I don't believe I can teach you much more

 about windows cracking, except, may be, how to gain a little more &quot;zen&quot;

 feeling when moving through the code. 

	I know that this concept is &quot;funny&quot; and that at times it is difficult

 to understand what I exactly mean... until you'll feel the code yourself.

	I will therefore concentrate now on preparing my two promised &quot;zen&quot;

 lessons, which I have not yet written.



	Since to feel something with &quot;zen&quot; requires to be free from petty

 conventions and to understand what's going on around you, I'll begin the

 &quot;zen&quot; introduction with two short &quot;modern zen&quot; examples: the &quot;bus

 conductor&quot; and &quot;the mineral water&quot;.

	(Read on +friends: you'll understand what I mean :=)



	I call this kind of things &quot;modern zen&quot; lacking a better definition

 of it, my essay about <A href="slaves.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/slaves.htm">supermarket domination</A> runs in the same line of

 thought... well, judge by yourself:

<FONT size="+2">

<B>+ORC's modern zen: The bus conductor</B>

</FONT>

	Once upon a time all busses in Europe had TWO men onboard: a driver

 (driving) and a bus &quot;conductor&quot;, who gave (and checked for) tickets,

 supervised the bus and told the driver to wait a minute if an old lady was

 slow in getting down from it. So was it in the fifties... in nice rural

 England, in the beautiful center of Lissabon and in rainy Paris... all

 over our beautiful and various old continent. Cities were clean and

 (almost) unpolluted, people used bikes and public transport a lot. Few

 noisy and stinky cars littered the main streets.

	This &quot;two people on board&quot; bus system allowed, inter alia, beautiful

 &quot;half-open&quot; busses, like the double decks in London and the &quot;ý impÈriale&quot;

 busses of Paris, these had an &quot;open&quot; part, where you could mount from the

 street (or get down) almost everywhere you wanted, provided that the bus

 halted at a red light (or simply had slowed down enough :=). Maximum

 flexibility, perfect service, quality, leather, brass, beautiful public

 transport facilities, you may still see some of them in the public

 transport museums nowadays.

	The presence of a conductor avoided most of the idiotic damages that

 the poor zombies cause nowadays to the public transports (instead of - for

 instance - painting with big white strips the private stinking cars parked

 on the zebra crossings,  these half-grown TV-zombies always damage only

 the public alternative, spraying everywhere their moronic signatures, like

 flies-shit... ) and the same reassuring presence contributed globally to

 the use of the public transports even at night (where now many choose to

 use their own cars, or a taxi, because they don't feel &quot;sure&quot; taking

 public transports late at night).

	The infamous &quot;privatization&quot; and &quot;rationalization&quot; trend of the last

 decades, basically aimed to degrade the quality of life in the whole world

 in order to allow more profits for the few that had the economic power,

 among many other damages, wiped away the &quot;conductors&quot; all over the world. 

	The bus driver was now &quot;the only man on board&quot;, he sold tickets (only

 if necessary, because people were invited or economically compelled to buy

 them, in blocks, elsewhere) <U>and</U> drove. Wouw! Only one salary to

 pay! How rational! How clever! How modern! 

	I'm sure that many little bureaucratic ass holes all over Europe have

 been <U>promoted</U> in the European traffic departments, in the seventies

 and in the eighties, for having (copied) such a big smart idea! (I don't

 need to explain you that such a smart idea was originally American, you'll

 have already devised it by yourself :=)

	And so they went rationalizing our busses, and tramways, and the few

 trolley busses that had survived the precedent rationalization wave, when

 all those non polluting, clean and silent electrically driven trolley

 busses had been replaced by expensive, polluting and noisy combustion

 motor busses... 

	My god, in the history books of the future they will speak of a

 century that allowed combustion motors in the center of the towns like we

 speak of last century England, that allowed child work in the mines...

 this or either they will allow again child work in the mines... everything

 is possible in the name of rationalization... 

	And so they went, cutting the bus companies staff by a half, a great

 and smart rationalization operation! Private transport companies' profits

 must have soared! Public transport companies must have feel &quot;good&quot; and

 &quot;modern&quot;, marching along, following the nice tunes of the spirit of the

 new times!

	In fact the real costs of this operation have of course been reversed

 onto the public sector, it is moreover difficult to see them, yet they are

 HUGE:



	Here is the equation pro bus:

----------------------------------------------------------------

TWO SALARIES =         2*2000        = 4000 US dollars per month* 

----------------------------------------------------------------

 * ONE SALARY                        = 2000 US dollars per month*

 * DAMAGES TO THE BUS  

(cleaning and repairing)             =  300 US dollars per month*

 * LESS PEOPLE TAKING THE BUS

(not only at night)                  =  300 US dollars per month**

 * UNCHECKED &quot;BLACK&quot; TRAVELLERS      =  200 US dollars per month*

 * ONE JOBLESS PERSON 

(would have been a &quot;conductor&quot;)      =  1000 US dollars per month*

 * ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES

 (caused by alternative use of cars) =   200 US dollars per month**

 * HEALTH DAMAGES

(caused by alternative use of cars)  =   200 US dollars per month**

TOTAL:                               =  4200 US dollars (at least)



*  = real figures fir a middle-sized European city of 1-2 millions 

     habitants

** = my own evaluation, keeping pretty low

----------------------------------------------------------------



	So the cost of having one employee instead of two is <U>the same</U>

 (or even slightly superior) than what you would have paid keeping two of

 them, yet the REPARTITION of such cost is quite different: The subsidy

 necessary to cushion the augmentation of jobless people are in fact NOT

 paid by any bus company (private or public), companies who could not care

 less about who will pay them. 

	More: the obvious consequence that if you have filthy and &quot;unsecured&quot;

 busses less people are going to use them, &quot;choosing&quot; private car

 transportation instead (and making therefore our cities more noisy and

 polluted, and diminishing even more the quality of life, a never ending

 &quot;evil circle&quot;), although causing a slightly inferior &quot;revenue&quot; for the

 company is greatly compensated by the halving of all salaries; health and

 environmental damages... what the cuckoo do they mean for a bus company?

 Man, we are speaking of budget balance here...

	C'mon, +ORC, are you seriously saying that each bus should have two

 attendants? Why not three then?

	Yes, why not? What is more EXPENSIVE for the society? One driver and

 two jobless drug addicts and a deteriorated town or three employees for

 each bus and an healthy community? Bus &quot;conductor&quot; is not an &quot;high

 qualification&quot; job, they could immediately pull a lot of people off the

 streets into regular work if they cared for it, <U>sparing</U> quite a lot

 of money... but the point is that they <U>do not care at all</U> and that

 speeches like mine are almost blasphemous in a society where the cloak of

 rationalization is used only to blind people, tricking them into loosing

 life quality and into political immobility through a well orchestrated

 propaganda machine in order, as always, to allow very few to make a lot of

 profit... (what's even worse is that I cannot any more get onto my bus at

 any red light either :=)

+ORC's modern zen: Mineral Water

</FONT>

	Once upon a time there was (almost) no mineral water on this planet.

	I know kids, you wont believe it. What did people drink in those long

 forgotten days? You'll ask.

	They drank <U>TAP WATER</U>. See: there was quite an ingenious system

 of tubes, that carried drink water in every home, everywhere. The water

 came directly in the kitchen and could be poured in a glass and drunk. The

 vestiges of that system are still there, and if you go in your kitchen

 you'll see a tap and eventually get some water out of it, but you wont

 probably drink it.  

	People don't drink tap water anymore, they go to the supermarket, pay

 in order to get 10 to 15 kilo heavy boxes of bottled mineral water in

 plastic and carry that weight home, once or twice every week, in order to

 drink. Well it's a big improvement: a century ago they had to go to the

 river and did not need to pay anything at all. 

	With the mountains of plastic waste they fill enormous plastic litter

 bags, that will be burnt somewhere, polluting the waters underneath, a

 nice circle.

	Why did that happen, you will say... hey! We thought we lived better

 than before... is'nt life a continuous progress? That's a common and

 widespread <U>superstition</U>, which almost all information sources

 you'll have access to will gladly confirm.

	I was also puzzled by this curious historical regression and checked,

 and made a little research on this subject. You will really not believe

 it, but you may check for yourself the relative regulamentation:

	The standards for drinking water, sewage infiltration protection,

 chlorine content and purity of the waters HAVE BEEN CONSTANTLY LOWERED,

 starting in the sixties, throughout Europe (I don't even dare to think how

 low such standards must be in the rest of the world). 

	This has many reasons, the main one being that the extensive

 agricultural system actually favored (of course for profit reasons) uses a

 lot of pesticides, which - of course - infect subterranean water reserves.

 Yet there has been also an obvious &quot;watermineral&quot; economical aspect, at

 least for the industry of this sector, which has <U>lobbied hard</U> to

 avoid any amelioration of the water purity standards. You are therefore

 compelled to have filthy water in your city because else you would not

 help the &quot;free market forces&quot; buying (and carrying home) &quot;their&quot; mineral

 water. You don't believe me? Check yourself.

	As I was a child (long ago) you would have found in any restaurant a

 bottle of common &quot;tap&quot; water on the table. I have not seen them since many

 years any more, in all the European countries I have visited (and I think

 I have visited almost all of them).

	Yes, as I have repeatedly told you: quality of life has been

 continuously and purposely lowered, in order to allow bigger profits for

 the few that control this awful society of stupid slaves: planes land

 noisy at night, whole suburbs abandoned to the savages, you have to carry

 heavy water home and your pensions (should you have the right to a

 pension) will be cut (or completely eliminated) in the near future in name

 of the &quot;rationalization&quot;. In the mean time all social cushions are being

 stripped off one by one, in name of the &quot;globalization&quot; and of the &quot;free

 play&quot; of the market forces, which are nothing else than the uncontrollable

 throbbing for profits of the few that control these markets.

	A nice society, think of it next time you sweat carrying home some

 mineral water... tell me the truth: you almost forgot that you had a tap

 in your kitchen, didn't you?



	Well, that's it for now, I think. 



Don't be deceived if there is nothing about cracking code above... decoding

 life is much more important than decoding code, and you wont be able to

 feel the code if you don't learn first to decode the world around you.

 This does not mean that you should believe or agree with everything I say.

 My personal opinions are my personal opinions and my &quot;modern zen&quot; writings

 are only based on my &quot;impressions&quot;. I am only using them as examples of a

 reality that often IS NOT what it seems, nor what it believes to be, nor

 what it says to be... in fact it is oft quite the contrary. What I said

 for mineral water could be transposed easily to handkerchiefs (did you

 ever calculated how much those &quot;kleenex&quot; and &quot;Scottex&quot; cost every year in

 relation to any old wet piece of cloth?); kids' toys (they are

 increasingly building toys made in order to RIP OFF kids of all fantasy

 possibilities: kids get toys that are ALREADY TAILORED for a single task,

 say &quot;Barbie's wedding&quot;, so that the kid asks for another toy instead of

 using the same for more than one task... recalls Micro$oft's strategy :-);

 modern houses (and modern furniture for that matter) are more and more

 made out of &quot;poor&quot; materials, bad jointed and bad assembled... the

 consequences appear only after 10 years or so, and who cares about what

 happens after 10 years? In the mean time you may have the joy of hearing

 all neighbors' toilets and discussions in a radius of 2 kilometers. Try

 moving in a house built before the second world war and you'll immediately

 notice the difference... But why should they care? Rich will live in

 (poorly build) isolated modern little villas (with an hour trip to go by

 car to work, the poor sods) and only poor people living in the urban

 ghettos will suffer... and so on and so on and so on.

	A devastated, scorched society, that's where we live in, a desert of

 intelligence where only some faint lights glow. Make so that your brain

 will help others to find the way to understand the world around them with

 unsullied eyes, that's the real task of a cracker.



	Because we are more than code crackers: we are reality crackers, my

 kids.
