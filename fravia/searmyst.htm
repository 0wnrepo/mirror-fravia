<P>

First elements of searchenginology - 1

<HR width=44%>

Well, ever wondered which among the search engines get more hits, which one 

does index more pages, which SEs 

are more spammed (where the relation between "noise" and relevant information is worse)?<BR>

And did you even wonder why there's <U>so much opportunistic spam</U> among 

the first links that most 

SE return (especially when too broad queries have been performed)?<BR>And did you ever think that each 

search engine has its own algos in order to refresh/accept/select/classify/list the results

of your queries... and that these same algos can be (pretty easily) cracked... and that 

many commercial 'slave-catchers' are doing "professionally" exactly that, 

in order to scrap some money 

from your useless clicks (destroying at the same time the value of the 

search engine services for million users)?<BR>

Good old fravia+ will now explain all this (at least in part), so that 

you may choose and use

better the SEs... and survive on the web!

<FONT size=+2><FONT color=blue>Some data</FONT></FONT><BR>

<B>Main SEs: Indexed pages, web-coverage and number of monthly visitors</B> 

(font: fravia's scripts, results for mid July)<PRE><U>Search engine		Indexed pages web coverage monthly visitors</U>

Altavista (AV)		150 Mil		42,9%  	 	 7 Mil

Hotbot (HB)		120 Mil		34,3%	 	 5 Mil

Northernlight (NL)	 85 Mil		24,3%	 	 3 Mil

Excite	(EX)		 50 Mil		14,3%		15 Mil

Infoseek (IS)		 33 Mil	 	 9,4%		13 Mil

Lycos (LY)		 31 Mil		 8,9%		10 Mil

Webcrawler (WC)		  3 Mil		 0,9%		 6 Mil

Yahoo (YA)		not		not		32 Mil</PRE>

<BR>

What can we conclude from these data? 

<UL><LI>

That librarian and researchers and anyone 

seeking hard-to-find information (like us) should by all means use Altavista or Inktomi 

(that powers Hotbot) or Norternlight.

<LI> That even Altavista, that indexes 140 million pages and crawls more than 

10 million 

pages per day (like HB and LY... most of the time to refresh 

links or to add manually submitted sites, NOT 

to search uncharted waters!) does only index LESS THAN HALF of the web! This makes it very important 

that you learn the OTHER search techniques (combing, klebing, etc.) that you'll find on my 

<IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif"

<LI> That people don't use nor access search engines based on their real or supposed quality, but 

rather moronically following the pre-chewed links that they find inside their 

browsers (AOL-browser, 

Netscape search page, etceteras). So the number of monthly visitors does 

not have ANY interest whatsoever 

in order to judge the quality of a search engine (actually the contrary, since 

the more visitors a SE has, the more incentive there is for the slave-catchers for 

putting commercial spam inside).

<LI>This said there are also other factors in play: 'link popularity' for instance should play a role 

when indexing, yet only HB, LY and WC take account of it; unfortunately 

not all search engines show the DATE of the 

fished links (AV, HB, IS, LY and NL do, EX and WC do not), which is useful for you in order to 

'guess' which info may be more fresh and up to date when you peruse your results. Text positioning plays 

also a role for many search engines, as you'll read below.

</UL>

<P>

<HR>

<FONT size=+2><FONT color=blue>Spam for clicking</FONT></FONT><BR>

<B>Spam</B>

Spam is, in the case of the search engines, something different from the usual email spam that 

you already hate, yet it is nevertheless an opportunistic crap. There are people all over the world, 

that scrap money luring lusers and zombies into clicking banners 

(after having sold to their 

unhappy clients the lie that clicking means 'commercial opportunity').<BR>

Those commercial slave-catchers have quickly understood a couple of simple truths:

<UL>

<LI>1) Lotta people use the Search engines (duh)

<LI>2) Each search engine uses more or less simple 

algorithms to index the links resulting from a query.

<LI>3) It is VERY important to be listed among the top 10 links reported by a search 

engine, because zombies and lusers, that dunnow nothing about searching, just go for it 

immediately instead of having a more thorough look at the results (or even, as I advice, instead 

of  

performing <U>the same</U> query using <U>MORE THAN ONE</U> search engine and evaluating the 

answers BEFORE running into sideways).

<LI>4) There's no need to have a try for quality: just create (for instance) hundred pages that 

click to each other and that carry text and tricks INTENDED TO FOOL THE SE's often por 'quality'  

algorithms.

</UL>

<P>

The consequence is that you'll find often enough  as answer to your queries 

only 'commercial' pages, that HAVE BEEN DESIGNED in order to figure among 

the first positions, instead of finding the true  

knowledge sites you're looking for, that don't care for this crap 'positioning'. 

It's as simple as that: the search engines that you are 

using are not giving you what you expect, nor what they are supposed to, they are 

just giving you tons of commercial spam. And millions of users are wasting time, 

so that the commercial slave-catchers can scrap some money, as ususal...<BR>

That's a reason good enough to cross the commercial

SE's spammers' planes, annoy them and eventually 

destroy their soo artefully designed sites, and I'll teach you how to do it...

<HR>

<FONT size=+2><FONT color=blue>Reversing search spiders</FONT></FONT><BR>

Any real reverser can quickly fool the SE's algos (commercial spammers, that are pretty stupid 

individuals, actually do it all the time - for money).<BR> 

Algos vary from search engine to search engine (of course, that's 

the reason the same query gives DIFFERENT results on each search engine, btw) and 

may be very simple or complex.<P>

The simplest way to reverse the SE's algos is to perform searches on very commercial 

subjects (those where the spammers from the 'insert site consulencies' battle a lot) 

and have a look at the first 15-30 sites that you'll get as result of your query. Your 

reversing blick will quickly pick up the relevant patterns...<BR>

Let's take as an example Excite, in order to let 

you grasp the complexity (and at the same time the banality) of the issues at stake.<BR>

The following is taken from my own essay <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif"

ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 

HSPACE=0><A href="botstart.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/botstart.htm">reversing search engines' bots</A>:

<UL><LI>

<B>Excite</B>: if you 

try to submit more than twenty pages then its spider will begin to penalize you. 



<LI><B>Excite</B>: is 

undergoing an indexing change right now, and in the mean time seems to have 

TWO spiders: a "roaming spider", now only looking for homepages, whose pages have a time limit 

(they will be drop after that) and a "Fresh Spider" which confirms page changes and 

submittals. It seems that on 21/7 the older algos took over and <B>Excite</B> 

started reindexing 

subpages (and not only index pages).



<LI><B>Excite</B>: has NOT all ist stuff stored on one huge computer, of course, 

but onto several. On one search 

one computer may be down, or overloaded, therefore <U>you may get different answers</U> for the 

same search on <B>Excite</B>.

<LI><B>Excite</B>: Since <B>Excite</B> has the habit to 'drop' pages, in order to spam 

<B>Excite</B>, 

most commercial slaves use (and need) two domains. They build say 10 doorway pages on domain A, 

and make sure that they have a page on domain B that links to each of those doorway pages.

<LI><B>Excite</B>: Since <B>Excite</B> is heavily used by the AOL types you should use alt tags, 

to identify buttons, etc, not to keyword stuff.

<LI><B>Excite</B>: Very sensible to spam from comment tags (at the bottom of the spammer's page), 

with complete sentences structured around his 'targeted keyword phrase' the searchstring where he 

hopes to appear among the first ten when queried.

<LI><B>Excite</B>: 'Relevant' links play a role in <B>Excite</B>'s algos: pages that come up on 

top are largely composed of a list of links to other pages.

<LI><B>Excite</B>'s algos punish spammers that repeat keywords closer than 7 words apart

<LI><B>Excite</B>'s algos give special attention to <U>the bottom of the page</U>, believing 

that most spammers place extra emphasis on placing words early in the document 

(top of the page). Notice how <B>Excite</B> spammers do not put any copyright or other nonsense 

after having placed their last set of spamming keywords, which are always the last thing on the 

page. 

<LI><B>Excite</B> falls for links named after the spammers' keywords (especially if on the bottom middle of 

the page).

<LI><B>Excite</B> falls for keywords put in the ALT tags of bullets.

<B>Excite</B> is using IMO 4 different algorithms, the two major ones are 

easy to see: each cycle lasting approx two weeks. Excite reversers can actually 

observe the "switch" on Monday morning.

<LI><B>Excite</B>: hidden text will get spammers banned from <B>Excite</B>, 

never to return again (they are very unforgiving).

</UL>





The above snippets are taken from the 'Excite' chapter of my 

own (unpublished) 'reversing search engines bots' small booklet, yet every single 

Search engine has its own idiosynchrasies.<BR>

Altavista, for instance, seems to be

rotating at least two ranking methods several 

times during the course of a day, in order to keep spammers at by. On Altavista, 

quite correctly, "root domains" get a 

relevancy boost, which frustrates spammers. But many other small things seem also to be 

in play. I believe, for instance, that <U>font size</U> increases keyword weight on some 

AV algos (because 

they assume that parts of text written in bigger fonts are more relevant for the page). 

Also If you try to submit more than 60 pages for a given domain, AV kills it... how do the 

spammers then spam in this case? They use a unix shell 

and start a lynx -dump. So they can submit 

20.000 pages in 4 hours from only one server. 

<BR>Altavista searches use moreover different algorithms depending of the 

PART of the database they are falling in: The main AV page uses one algorithm, yet the 

small AV search panel in Micro$oft's Explorer 4 and up (yes, you'll have to lower yourself to 

use this puke browser too, if you want to fish algos on the search engines), uses a 

different algorithm at AV. You can tell that the M$IE searches are different, because 

they will have a "<B>n200</B>" in the referer string in your logs. 

AltaVista algos are based on the oldest search engine, the one in use on the 

web of the 'older ones', and AV is THEREFORE still the best place to find 

detailed information, even if the submitters (or spalmmers) never indended to 

list it that way. AV bots still follow all links they find, and sometime they 

go 'crazy' and chart NEW UNDISCOVERED TERRAIN, something that happens very seldom 

on most other Search engines. I personally hope that AV will retain is roots, 

and crawl and list as it does now, even though the net is becoming more and more 

commercial, notwithstanding all our efforts.





<BR><BR>



If you are interested in this kind of stuff (hopefully not in order to spam on your own :-) 

you may want to reverse some algos by yourself

 and have a general look around at the  various spammers newsgroups (yes, they exchange their 

findings on the web: 'I got three clients into the top AV 10, but cannot get them in WC" and so on).<BR>Anyway, one of the results of this awful "commercial 

oriented" activity (these assholes would sell their sisters for a couple of clicks) 

is that MOST OF THE TIME 

you can and must FORGET the first 10% positioned links of any query result you'll get. 

Yes, you understood me right: all search engines anti-spam tricks notwistanding (at the moment the more 

refined antispammer is probably Infoseek, since it was for ages the most spammed SE) the first results of any query will 

NOT be relevant, because of the spam (unless your query is very specific).<BR>

Well, 

if you don't believe me, just try it: the more 'broad' your search category, the more useless 

will be all links that have been reported in the first positions. You'll have more luck, probably, 

when you start after the first relevant 10%. <P>

There are a couple of tricks you can use:<BR><B>Jump the first results</B><BR>

Say you have searched for instance three terms, and you get term1 100000, term2 2000, term3 40000.<BR>

Now you know that 'first broad relevant'  palette is 2000 (term2 findings). 10% is 200, you may 

begin your search at 'page' 20 of your results, don't worry, you won't loose much.<BR>

<B>Negate spammers</B><BR>

Have a look at the first page, see if there are several hits from the same spammer among the 

first 10, say you see three hits from <FONT color=blue>http://www.spammon.com</FONT>, just 

add to the search string (that should still be inside the search window) <FONT color=blue>-spammon</FONT> and 

have a look at the first 10 hits you get NOW. Repeat until necessary. 

<BR><BR><B>

Punish Spammers</B><BR>



 An interesting idea is to 

'punish' spammers sites on your own, simply resubmitting them with 

a lot of hidden spamming text that YOU have added... The search engines algos 

will exclude them; mostly without warning.  :-)<BR>

Alternatively you can email the search engines with your favourite spammer target, just 

remember to keep it very factual and to the point. Also, maintain a 

professional level. No all caps screams, no judgements about it. Just the facts: 

"On such-and-such search, such and such commercial domain is dominating the results, 

disallowing the searcher access to a varity of real results from which to choose."

<HR>

<FONT size=+2><FONT color=blue>Write your own search bots</FONT></FONT><BR>

Uff! It's a long way to come to term with the search engines, isn't it? Well, there's ANOTHER 

way: write yourself your dedicated search bots, it's easier than you may think, and works MUCH 

better than being delivered to the whims of the (at times comical) algos of the main SEs.<BR>

When you'll have learned 

how to write your own search bots (study perl, my son) you'll be able to incorporate these tricks inside

your own probes... yes... as you now probably understand: public 

search engines may be used if you have nothing better, but your own search bots will be much better!



<UL><LI>They will explore uncharted waters MUCH MORE than the

 commercial oriented search engines. Unfortunately there's nowaday 

a ugly trend towards 'sampling' and away from 'real indexing', of course the commercial slave-catchers 

could not care less about information, contents or knowledge: 

what they want is a 'cow-park' of million of drooling lusers 

that keep clicking around the same bogus useless sites for the eternity, so why should they 

index the <U>real</U> web when they can have the same money from much less work?

<LI>They will not follow algos you don't control;

<LI>They will never allow paying sites to emerge among the first positions (as many search 

engines do);

<LI>They will not be so easily spammed;

<LI>They will find exactly the info you need and follow the links you (and not some 

American commercial slave-catcher) will have decided!

<HR><H2>Fravia's tips for your own site</H2><BR>

OK, there have been so many that have written me praying for some tips in order to ameliorate 

the ranking of their own pages, that -even if I don't really agree- I am 

going to publish the following. I sincerely hope that most 

of my readers are just 'correct' people that need a boost for their clever reversing site, 

not commercial spammers that will misuse this info for 

money. You may also notice that I -purposely- DO NOT use these same tips in order 

to boost the position of my own site (nor I advertise on usenet for it) since 

I DO NOT WANT TO BOOST MY SITE TOO MUCH. I believe in fact that the 

quantity of people reading my site, but the QUALITY of that people makes the real 

difference (as usual on all sectors of life). 

Anyway here we go and let's just hope you won't use this to sell some  pathetical 

crap on the web... btw, the following is strongly Altavista geared...<BR><BR>

<UL><LI>

Use &lt;h1&gt;key words&lt;/h1&gt; header first. Include only targeted key words - no stop words. 

</LI><LI>

Use one short paragraph after the header with the key words first. 

</LI><LI>

Repeat the key word phrase twice in the first 25 words of the page. 

</LI><LI>

AV stems words so "crack cracking cracker" counts as three "crack". 

</LI><LI>

Repeat the key word(s) no more than three times: 

software reversing software protections software cracking is ok. 

</LI><LI>

The order of key words in a key word phrase is not important. 

"software reversing" or "reversing software" it's the same. 

</LI><LI>

Alt tags are indexed. 

<BR>

Comment tags are indexed. 

<BR>

&lt;a HREF="mailto:luser@aol.net">key words</A> and &lt;a href>key words&lt;/a> are indexed. 





</LI><LI>meta tag key words: 

keep it short 

use comma-separated words. It depends how people will search you, though. Since the 

masses predominantly search in "lower case", and use simple one and two word phrases, 

without quotes surrounding the phrase, you can probably leave it, yet if you believe that 

most of the people searching for you will know the searching ABC, then your

keyword phrases (in AV) should be in their own quotes eg. "reverse engineering" instead of <REVERSE engineering, stuff,...">

</li><li>

Keep key words near each other and near the beginning of the page. 

</li><li>

Make the key words 3-5% of the total text which is visible by the browser. (View your page with the browser. Start in the upper left hand corner of the page and highlight all the text by dragging the mouse cursor to the end of the page. Copy/paste to an html editor or word processor and count

</li></uL>

<br>

This said, "tip" sheets are not much worth, since the SEs algos are continuously improving, 

and obvious spamming techniques will get you nowhere. Most "tip" sheets on SE positioning, 

that you will find around the web can be paralleled to buying a "tip" sheet at a race track. 

They are usually wrong. Trust your instincts, <u>study</u> and <u>reverse</u> as 

much as you can, and experiment with different strategies...
