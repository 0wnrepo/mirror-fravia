    <P>Well, this is my contribution to fravia's bots

reversing 

section. Until

      now I haven't contributed at all to fravia's

excellent site, 

thinking that

      it would simply be a waste of time. That is,

until I came across 

the

      Reality Cracking section. Reading through this,

I discovered 

that there

      was not much there that I had not already

&amp;quot;reversed&amp;quot;. 

The

      discovery that I might actually have something

to contribute 

that you

      +masters don't already know came as a bit of a

wake-up call. 

Shortly

      afterwards I landed at the entrance to the bot

wars section and 

then

      decided to have a go at &amp;quot;earning&amp;quot;

access to the bot 

wars

      section. Perhaps you know everything I will

discuss here, but 

what the

      hell, at least I tried :-). I plan to contribute

an essay to the 

&amp;quot;Reality

      Cracking&amp;quot; section if this essay doesn't

qualify me as 

worthy of

      entrance to the &amp;quot;Bot Wars&amp;quot; pages.

(Hell, I'll probably 

send it

      in even if I do :-) )</P>

    

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Overview</FONT></B></P>

    

    <P>Ok, basically this essay will be a compilation

of the type of

      Bots/Scripts I have encountered on IRC, and

methods of tricking, 

nuking,

      and combatting them. (BTW, Reality Cracking

skills can be quite 

useful on

      IRC, as with a bit of psychology you can get

your average 

clueless &amp;quot;w4r3z

      k1dd1e&amp;quot; to unknowingly give you the

information you seek.) 

Some of

      these tricks will probably be old hat for some

of you, but I 

hope most of

      you will find something new or interesting in

here. Some of the 

methods I

      will teach in this essay will wander slightly

off the topic of 

&amp;quot;Bot

      Wars&amp;quot;, but with good reason. Anyway, you

want to learn 

about IRC

      Bots, not read my blabbering, so onward to the

battlefield! 

:-)</P>

    

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Advertisement

Bots</FONT></B></P>

    

    <P>The first type of bot that I will explain is

the simple, 

annoying, and

      widespread &amp;quot;advertisement bot&amp;quot;. This

type of bot will 

be

      encountered on joining any large chat or warez

channel on any of 

the large

      IRC networks (ie. EFNet, Undernet, DALNet, etc.)

This bot works 

by sending

      a private message to every person joining the

channel it is 

active on,

      thus (depending on your IRC client) flooding

your screen, 

popping up

      numerous windows, or causing annoying beeps.

Mostly these are 

worthless

      and dumb, eg. &amp;quot;f0r 4ll y0ur

w4r3z/pr0n/cr4ck1ng n33ds cum 2

      <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://lamer.site.org/lamer/page.htm"  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://lamer.site.org/lamer/page.htm"'" tppabs="http://lamer.site.org/lamer/page.htm"" target=_blank>http://lamer.site.org/lamer/page.htm&quot;</A>. Once

in a while you 

will find

      something actually interesting in one of these

messages or on 

one of these

      &amp;quot;k-k3wl w4r3z s1t3z&amp;quot; but on the whole

you are wasting 

your time

      reading these messages and going to the

sites.</P>

    

    <P><B>The Passive Defences</B></P>

    

    <P>The simplest way to combat the annoying effects

of these bots 

is to

      setup your IRC client to ignore all private

messages/notices for 

about 5

      seconds after joining a channel. While being

quite easy to 

implement, this

      has the nasty side effect of filtering out all

of your genuine 

messages

      during that time. You can avoid that by setting

your client not 

to ignore

      message from people with whom you have a chat

window open to. 

However this

      is not possible in some IRC clients. Another

approach is to have 

everyone

      ignored by default, and then to un-ignore anyone

you send a 

message to.

      This also filters the &amp;quot;1 n33D h3Lp w1Th mY

W4r3Z&amp;quot; 

message you

      get from time to time, but once again is not

possible in some 

IRC clients.

      Finally, you can simply ignore all private

messages/notices 

completely,

      and when you find it necessary to start a

private chat, use DCC 

or start a

      new channel and make it +i (invite only).</P>

    

    <P><B>The Active Defences</B></P>

    

    <P>Ok, so you don't want to just ignore the bots,

you want to get 

rid of

      them completely? Then this is where you need to

look. The 

easiest way to

      get rid of one of these bots is to set up some

clonebots 

yourself (see the

      <A HREF="#tools">tools</A> section near the end

of this essay) 

and set

      them to rapidly join and re-join the channel.

The advertisment 

bot will

      attempt to advertise to each bot every time they

join, and this 

will cause

      the IRC server to disconnect them for flooding.

The more bots 

you use for

      this technique, the easier it is to disconnect

the advert bot. 

However the

      problem with this technique is that it causes

extreme annoyance 

for anyone

      else in the channel, and may get you banned. So

do a /whois 

&amp;lt;bot name&amp;gt;

      to find out what channels the bot is in, then

pick one of the 

worthless

      ones to perform this trick in. Please note,

however, that using 

clonebots

      may get you banned from some IRC networks.</P>

    

    <P>Another way of doing it is to create your own

channel, then do 

a /invite

      &amp;lt;bot name&amp;gt; #channel to invite the bot to

that channel. 

Depending on

      the bot's setup, it may automatically join the

channel, or 

simply pop up a

      message to the owner of the bot. If the bot

joins the channel, 

simply use

      the technique described above to kill the bot.

Depending on how 

the bot is

      setup, you may have gotten rid of the bot until

its owner 

notices.

      However, some bots are programmed to

automatically reconnect and 

rejoin

      the channels they were in. If this is the case,

then some more 

advanced

      techniques must be used. Typing /dns &amp;lt;bot

name&amp;gt; will get 

you their

      IP address, which may then be used with a

variety of 

&amp;quot;nuking&amp;quot;

      tools (see the <A HREF="#tools">tools</A>

section) to disconnect 

and/or

      crash the computer the bot is running on.</P>

    

    <P>On some IRC networks/servers this kind of bot

is banned, so 

getting rid

      of it will be as simple as reporting it to a

Server Operater or 

IRCOp (the

      people responsible for administering the IRC

network) who will 

usually

      kill them (force the server to disconnect them)

with a warning, 

and then

      k-line them (ban them from the server) if they

continue 

advertising. In

      fact, on many IRC networks/servers bots of any

kind are totally 

banned.</P>

    

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Protection / Administration 

Bots</FONT></B></P>

    

    <P>The purpose of these bots is to control an IRC 

network/channel(s) eg.

      automatically opping people, banning abusers,

keeping the 

channel topic,

      keeping the channel open, passing on messages,

etc. There are 

basically

      two kinds of these bots: the IRC

server/network-run bots, and 

the

      privately run bots. The IRC server/network-run

bots are the ones 

like W,

      X, and Y on Undernet, and the Nickserv,

Chanserv, and Memoserv 

bots on

      DALNet and many other networks. Nickserv bots

are the ones that 

allow you

      to register your nickname with a password that

must be entered 

within a

      certain period of time after connecting

otherwise you are 

killed. This

      stops people from taking over channels ie.

deopping all the 

legitimate

      users by pretending to be a channel

&amp;quot;reg&amp;quot; (regular, 

someone who

      has been in the channel for some time, and thus

usually gets 

ops).

      Chanserv is also to prevent takeovers, by

allowing one to de-op, 

kick, and

      ban people with the use of a channel password.

Memoserv allows 

you to send

      a message to someone with a registered nickname

even if they are 

not

      currently connected to the IRC network. The W,

X, and Y bots on 

Undernet

      are basically Chanserv-type bots. Depending on

the IRC network, 

these bots

      may actually be programs, or a part of the IRC

server 

software.</P>

    

    <P><B>The Passive Defences</B> </P>

    

    <P>Well, the purpose of these bots is usually to

control a 

channel, and

      there's not much you can do to stop the owner of

the bot setting 

it to ban

      you whenever you join. Just be nice to the

people who run the 

channel/bots

      and you won't have too many troubles, unless

they are assholes, 

which they

      unfortunately often are. (Hint: employ some

&amp;quot;reality 

cracking&amp;quot;

      techniques)</P>

    

    <P><B>The Active Defences</B></P>

    

    <P>Now why on earth would you want to

&amp;quot;nuke&amp;quot; one of 

these bots?

      To kick all the clueless warez kiddies from

their warez channels 

and piss

      them off? You evil person! :-) Actually, these

kind of bots are 

often used

      by the aforementioned warez kiddies to keep you

out of your own 

channels

      after they have taken them over. You careless

person you, how 

could you

      let them take your channels over? Serves you

right. Well, I'm 

not going to

      help you. :-) Oh, ok, if you insist. Maybe I

will teach you a 

trick or two

      after all. But only if you promise never to use

them on someone 

else's

      channel. Of course, that thought would never

cross your mind 

would it?

      Especially when you join one of the many

&amp;quot;k1dd13 pr0n&amp;quot; 

channels

      on IRC and disgust yourselves at the content

being exchanged, 

now would

      it? :-)</P>

    

    <P>The simplest method is to change your nickname,

and flatter the 

&amp;quot;k-k3wl

      d00d&amp;quot; with statements like &amp;quot;boy, are

you 

313373/3l33t/l33t or

      what!&amp;quot; or whatever other nonsense seems to

be appropriate. 

Since you

      are probably the first, and last person to say

things like that 

to him,

      he'll op you on the condition that &amp;quot;iF y3w

d0 4nYtH1nG b4d 

3y3 w1lL

      h4x0r y3w&amp;quot;. Being the clueless lamer he is,

he probably 

won't be able

      to do anything about it, especially if you are

running some form 

of

      firewall eg. Conseal PC Firewall, NukeNabber

(not so good tho), 

or

      something else. (You do know how to search the

web, don't you?) 

Now that

      you have ops, de-op and kick the loser and his

bot, and you are 

done. Make

      sure you de-op them simultaneously, and before

you kick them 

otherwise the

      bot will protect the loser, and vice-versa.

However, if he is 

slightly

      more clever he will have more bots than you can

simultaneously 

de-op and

      then you are screwed. Bummer. (On some IRC

networks the limit is 

4 de-ops

      at a time, on others it is 6)</P>

    

    <P>Well, not really. If these bots are advert bots

as well, for 

example,

      you can use the techniques described in my

advert bots section 

above. Or

      you can use the bogus ban technique. But what

the hell is a 

bogus ban, you

      ask. There are two types of bogus ban. The first

is when you set 

a ban

      with weird characters that the bot can't handle,

and so it 

crashes. The

      other technique is to ban a whole bunch of

people and then unban 

them, and

      then ban them, and then unban them, etc. Some

bots will not be 

able to

      handle this, and will run out of memory and

crash. Now that you 

have

      eleminated at least some of the bots, you can

proceed to de-op 

and kick

      the remaining bots. For best results, of course,

these steps 

should be

      performed in rapid succession. </P>

    

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Clone / Flood / War

Bots</FONT></B> </P>

    

    <P>The Clone/Flood/War bot has the potential to be

the most 

powerful, and

      the most annoying, and the most stupid kind of

bot you'll ever 

meet. These

      bots range from the clone bots, which simply

join and re-join 

the channel,

      flooding everyone with join and part messages,

to the kind that 

spam you

      with thousands of messages, to the kind that

spam you with CTCP 

PINGs,

      VERSIONs or other messages that are replied to

by your IRC 

client, and

      thus cause you to be ejected from your server

due to flood 

protection.</P>

    

    <P><B>Passive / Active Defenses</B></P>

    

    <P>The join/part bots are easy to protect against,

simply program 

your

      client/script to ban anyone who joins a channel

more than say 4 

times in

      10 seconds. If the bot is changing nicks, and

also joning and 

rejoining

      continuously, then simply examine the

hostname/IP address insted 

of the

      nickname. Also set your client to kick/ban

anyone changing nicks 

more than

      say 5 times in 10 seconds. This will prevent

annoying nick 

change floods.

      For text/CTCP flooding, most clients can also be

set to ignore 

anyone who

      sends you multiple messages in a short period of

time. Finally, 

annoying

      bots like these are banned on most IRC

servers/networks, so 

report the

      bots to one of the Server Ops, or IRCOps and

they will be killed 

and/or

      banned from the IRC network/server.</P>

    

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1"><A

NAME="tools">Tools</A></FONT></B></P>

    

    <P>Ok, so you don't know how to program your IRC

client to do the 

tricks

      described above, or you can't find programs to

do it for you, so 

you want

      me to tell you how to do it? You lazy bastard!

Go program it 

yourself :-).

      But I will give you some starting points and

hints.</P>

    

    <P>Firstly, a good IRC client is imperative. On

the whole, I would 

say that

      mIRC (<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.mirc.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.mirc.com/'" tppabs="http://www.mirc.com/" target=_blank>http://www.mirc.com/</A>) is the most

powerful, but pIRCh is 

also a

      popular favorite. One feature it has over mIRC

is the ability to 

connect

      to multiple IRC servers at the same time. Both

of these clients 

are

      available from TUCOWS, (<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.tucows.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.tucows.com/'" tppabs="http://www.tucows.com/" target=_blank>http://www.tucows.com/</A>),

a valuable 

source of

      Internet Tools.</P>

    

    <P>Next you should look for a good script. A

little searching 

never hurt,

      but one of the best places to go for mIRC

scripts is

      <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.mircx.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.mircx.com/'" tppabs="http://www.mircx.com/" target=_blank>http://www.mircx.com/</A>. One of the best mIRC

scripts is 7thSphere 

v3.0,

      although you should ameliorate and change it to

suit your own 

needs. It

      also comes with some useful utilities.</P>

    

    <P>For nuking utilities, look for the following:

</P>

    <UL>

      <LI>WinNuke (even built-in to some mIRC

scripts!) which crashes 

unpatched

        Windows machines using Winsock v1.x.</LI>

      <LI>Click Nuker, which spoofs ICMP unreachable

packets causing 

the IRC

        client to think that the connection to the IRC

server has 

finished.

        (This comes with 7thSphere v3.0)</LI>

      <LI>Wako CloneBots, a simple program for running

clone/floodbots 

(also

        comes with 7thSphere v3.0)</LI>

      <LI>Teardrop, an exploit that sends a broken

TCP/IP packet that 

will

        crash many unpatched machines.</LI>

      <LI>Smurf, guaranteed to kill almost any

machine, and almost 

impossible

        to protect against.</LI>

      <LI>Land, another TCP/IP exploit, works best

against IRC clients 

on

        Windows 95.</LI>

      <LI>Nestea v2, yet another TCP/IP exploit.</LI>

    </UL>

    

    <P>Do some research on TCP/IP and all of the

numerous exploits 

available,

      and then write your own utilities. Linux

source-code is 

available for

      almost all of these exploits. And get a good

virus scanner (I 

recommend

      ThunderByte Antivirus), as many people think

embedding 

viruses/trojans in

      nukers etc. is smart and &amp;quot;3l33t&amp;quot;.</P>

    

    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1">Taking it

further</FONT></B></P>

    

    <P>With the use of the /dns &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt; command

you can find out 

the IP

      address of the bots/losers, obviously useful for

stalkign 

purposes.

      Another command some people will not know of is

/whois 

&amp;lt;nick&amp;gt; &amp;lt;nick&amp;gt;.

      This will give you not only the usual whois

info, but also the 

length of

      time they have been idle, useful for

establishing their time 

zone etc. You

      should also log every IRC session, to leave a

record of what you 

have

      done/found out. Also, searching large archives

of IRC logs may 

find you

      some interesting info :-). Use your imagination!

Be creative! 

And most

      importantly, keep on learning and

researching.</P>
