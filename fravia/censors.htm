<FONT size=+3>What now</FONT><BR></CENTER>

<FONT size=+3>S</FONT>harp's server has been destroyed, censored by a puritan 

american bogus organisation. Sharp hosted, among other pages, my "tana", 

+gthorne's page and Stone's site.<BR>My page still survives: you are reading it. Yet I need 

more mirrors. Especially I need a new "tana", i.e. a complete  

copy of my main site that I'll update regularly (the perfect mirror, as 

fallback in case of server problems and/or attacks against my "fortress").<BR> If you 

have a solide place (<U>stable</U> for at least a couple of years) for a copy 

of my site (approx 20-25 Megabytes) on your (FAST!) server, please, by 

all means, contact 

me at fravia(at)fravia(point)org 

immediately. Servers OUTSIDE the United States are particularly welcomed. Estimated 

hitload of my "tana": ca 2000 per day IF THE FORTRESS IS WORKING, 

else <U>much</U> more :-)

<FONT size=+3>T</FONT>hey never censor smutsites

they never censor commercial warez sites

they never censor Bill for nuking his concurrence

they never censor people exploiting other people's bodies

or the gullible religious ones

or the kids, bombarded with useless frills

that will make slaves out of them

they never censor people exploiting other people's future

they don't censor anybody

making money 

they respect money

oh yes

they love money

they understand money very well

they love censorship too

so they censor people that think

and, especially, 

they censor those that help others to think

the dangerous ones, the ones giving knowledge away for free

they censor thinking, they censor alternatives

to their own dull and gray world

they censored my good friend Greythorne's site

a site with no warez whatsoever

but with a lot of knowledge for free

with a lot of work behind, unpaid, ready 

for anybody to take

they censor people that give away for free 

their own work

a blasphemy for them

giving knowledge for free

that they don't even understand

giving knowledge for free

they have already lost, poor little censors,

our web is undermining their whole life

their commercial stupidity is their own doom

all things they believe in are disappearing

our world is taking place

virtually yet inexorably

giving knowledge for free

sweeping the censor of the hideous past away

<BR><FONT size=+3>Black Friday's attack</FONT><BR></CENTER>

<FONT size=+3>I</FONT>t happened actually on Thursday 12 1998, between 

13:00 and 19:00 European Union time.<BR>

An American puritan censorship organization has attacked Sharp's 

server, hosting such fine pages like greythorne's, Stone's, 

Jammer's and a copy of mine own, compelling -probably- the local smut 

owners to throw our friend Sharp out, so that instead of knowledge 

for free the same server can now offer only "allowed" smut for money, 

which is perfectly ok, following the dire rules of the censors' 

weltanschauung.</PRE>

<FONT size=+3>I'</FONT>m not amused at all: read the <A href="censors.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/censors.gif">rhetorical 'manifesto'</A> of the asp 

censors and compare with the truth: they censored <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://greythorne.home.ml.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://greythorne.home.ml.org/'" tppabs="http://greythorne.home.ml.org/">greythorne</A>'s page, 

Stone's page and my own page 

(that you can still visit on the "fortress" at 

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.fravia.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.fravia.org/'" tppabs="http://www.fravia.org/">http://www.fravia.org</A>). These pages 

have NEVER hosted any pirated software whatsoever (why should we? if we need 

software -which we mostly don't- either we remove ourselves any protection 

it has or, even quicker at times :-) we know, as anyone else on the web, where 

to find the complete regged last version of it in the warez world.<PRE>

<FONT size=+3>A</FONT>nd see, exactly THAT is the point.<BR>

<FONT size=+3>T</FONT>hey don't care, contrarily to what they profess, 

nor disturb in any way those people that have gone commercial and are 

doing bucks with pirated software, when they say that they want to 

protect copyrights that's only a 'legal' and 'nice' masquerade used 

in order to take the public on a boat ride, especially on a web where 

Netscape itself is now releasing for free all his code as a last 

desperate move against the Micro$oft's bane... which reversed Netscape 

black and blue in order to speed Mosaic up to Msie... where were the 

censors at that time?



No! what these lackeys patrol, fear, loath and attack are sites giving 

away knowledge for free. 

That's the only thing they really hate, because censors and knowledge are 

mortal enemies, as they always have been, as they always will be.<BR><HR>

<CENTER>

<BR><FONT size=+3>What I will do</FONT><BR></CENTER>

<FONT size=+3>I</FONT> will punish the censors stalking them and answering with various means 

on more levels, of course, but the best answer will come from you all: just 

work. Let's tackle the more and more complicate and difficult protection schemes 

that are (finally) starting to appear: let's reverse anything in sight, day after 

day, with our quiet and MIGHTY approach... as +ORC would say: let's work well.

We are not doing anything illegal, in fact, we are teaching how to reverse 

engineer software AND software protection schemes. So what? I'll do this as long 

as I like, until I'll see a law (a LAW, not a wishful rhetorical statement by 

some bogus American organisation) that impose to the European Union's citiziens 

not to do it. And if that should ever happen, I'll fight AGAINST that law and 

try to modify it.

And if that fail I'll find another way to spread our knowledge. 

You won't have me.

Never.
