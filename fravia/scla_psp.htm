very good site towards  

the beginning of the year, with Crackz's good comments, that I (fravia+) will therefore simply 

reproduce here.</center><hr width="44%"></i><pre>

This essay is a 'must' read for any newbie still confused by 

the registry, who would have thought that the outstanding author 

of PSP (Bob Black) would use such a lousy scheme. I commend the 

methodical approach used by Santa Clawz here, as he shows YOU his 

thought processes. Protectionists must now surely realise that 

storing your most precious asset inside a few registry keys is 

very dumb. Enjoy this great tutorial and btw I have myself 

purchased this very good graphics program.

By now you probably have at least one copy of Paint Shop Pro on a CD in your 

mass of cover CD's. However, dig around your collection that dates between July 

and December 98 and you will probably find version 5 - this is our target 

program. Paint Shop Pro is essentially the most popular graphics package found 

on most cover CD's of most computer magazines and is almost definitely available 

on the web :-).

<p> 

This tutorial is really set out to be a good lesson in cracking time 

restricted programs from one newbie to others and to encourage all 

newbies to study their target's protection (or lack of it! :-) as 

closely as possible before diving into the deep end!.<br><br>

Jasc (the authors of PSP) give no opportunity to register their program 

directly from the interface, so they are not silly in that respect. 

However, they stress that this fully functional program is for 

evaluation purposes only and limit it to be used for 30 days (it 

will automatically terminate after 60) before asking you to beggar 

off and buy the full version. 

<p>

However, we will destroy the code that tells the program to check somewhere 

for the limit. Of course if you wish to use this program for ever go and 

buy it!.

OK, now that you have installed the proggie load it up and you will get a 

message on a nag_screen

<p>

What a welcoming screen! click on start and have a play for a bit and then come back 

to this tutorial! Now next time you load it up, before so execute RegMon 

(remembering to put &quot;regmon;explorer&quot; in the Processes exclude line in the 

filter) and watch all the calls to and from the registry that PSP makes 

(watch it! There are hundreds!). 

<p>

Hmm, did you want to get any sleep? Didn't think so! Well, we are only 

concerned with the ones made earlier (upon entry rather than exit) where the 

program will check the registry for it's installation date and number of

times it has been run. However, the programmers here were not stupid enough to 

put these values in the usual installation or program key of: 

<p>

HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\JASC\Paint Shop Pro 5 

<p>

Oh no! They put it somewhere were you wouldn't really think of going! I hope 

you haven't closed RegMon yet - you still need it open (but close PSP5). 

Search for {84124FF1-5D04-11D1-A575-00A0C96F2B0D} within RegMon and bang! 

&quot;What?&quot; I hear you say. Well, double click on it and you find out. Firstly 

though, I will just tell you why and how I discovered this holds our key to 

freedom. 

<p>

I simply searched through all the calls for a while making a mental note of all the ones 

that would seem too obvious to hold a special value. When I came across the 

ridiculous looking {84124FF1-5D04-11D1-A575-00A0C96F2B0D} I thought to myself hmm. 

I wonder... so I double clicked on the same line you should have done by now 

and the registry opened at the right place. 

<p>

Now back to the registry (don't worry the last paragraph will continue to be 

explained in this section). You should now collapse this key to reveal a number 

of other subkeys: AuxUserType; DefaultIcon; InprocHandler32; Insertable; 

LocalServer32; ProgID; MiscStatus; MS; Verb. If you look through any of them 

you will find they all have something to do with PSP (funny that!). The one we 

are concerned with though is MS. Now close RegMon but keep Regedit open at

HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{84124FF1-5D04-11D1-A575-00A0C96F2B0D}\MS (you should 

be looking at this anyway) and run Paint Shop Pro again.

<p>

After you have clicked &quot;Yes&quot; on the nag screen and close PSP go back to Regedit 

and refresh the display you will see that the two DWORD values iPID50t and iPID50u 

have changed. The second value of iPID50u has been incremented by 1 and will be 

each time you run PSP (try it and watch the number increase). The first value 

of iPID50t holds the important info of when your period is meant to expire (it 

doesn't matter how many times you run it within this time). So if you delete these two 

values your PSP program will go back to day one and run times of 0. However, the clock 

is still ticking. 

<p>

Well, we've done the simple bit of finding in the registry where our program 

looks for the date check :-) and now it is time to get into the nitty gritty 

of byte manipulation and ASM code cracking - the fun part! So load up first of 

all W32Dasm and create your deadlisting making sure you have at least 40Mb space 

for the file (it will be this big!) and in the mean time depending on what time 

it is mix yourself a good drink because it will take about 15 to 20 mins to 

disassemble! I recommend, if it is morning a strong coffee, afternoon a cup of 

tea or if it is evening/late night :-) either a good beer (bitter) or a Vodka 

Martini!.

<p>

OK, so your back with your all important rations and ready for the trek ahead. 

If you do a String reference search you won't find much on registering the 

product although you will find the two DWORD values from the registry I spoke 

of earlier; iPID50t and iPID50u, how interesting! This does mean that the PSP 

program accesses the registry around this point. Lets have a look at the 

disassembled code...

We can see from this section of the disassembly that the ADVAPI32.dll opens 

the keys mentioned previously <font color="blue">

(HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{84124FF1-5D04-11D1-A575-00A0C96F2B0D}\MS)</font> 

this snippet shows the last subkey &quot;MS&quot; being opened. Further down the code the 

string references show the two values we also found using RegMon. So far so 

good, nothing to get lost in :). There is a real goldmine of code here in this

listing and I hope you can spot it! Yup, thats it! Underneath the &quot;iPID50t&quot; and 

&quot;iPID50u&quot; strings the ASM code for each reference is pretty much the same! Let's 

take a closer look... 

<p>

<code>

* Possible StringData Ref from Data Obj -&gt;&quot;iPID50t&quot;; This one checks the

<p>

OK, there are two ways you could go from here in *cracking* the program 

(I have done both and both work). However, one is better than the other. 

<p>

<h4><u>The Crack</u></h4>

Right now you need your Hex editor, I prefer Hex Workshop :) but as usual 

any will do that you know how to use! Load it up and be ready to 

manipulate the bytes. Before we go any further I will explain the two 

ways of cracking this program. The first way (the way I discovered first) 

is to delete the two DWORD values in the registry first and then change 

the exe file in a Hex editor. In Hex Workshop I zeroed the two values 

i.e. changed &quot;69504944353074&quot; and &quot;69504944353075&quot; (these are iPID50t 

and iPID50u in hexadecimal) both to &quot;00000000000000&quot;. This would then 

clear the registry of the data PSP looks for (Note: these values will 

never show up in the registry now).

<p>

Then secondly (the actual crack) change a JE to JMP. This can be found at 

:00585B62 7477 JZ 00585BDB in your deadlisting. That is it - I will not 

go any further with that because I feel the next way is better.

<p>

Take two! If you study the last code snippet you will notice 2 conditional 

jumps (jne) one in each string reference procedure. All we need to do 

here is to change them to unconditional jumps. So load up your Hex 

editor and search for the bytes 750E8B54242C.

<p>

The only byte we want to change in this string of numbers is 75 (the 

others are simply there to narrow the search down), this is the opcode 

for jne. As we want to change this to jmp we shall change it to EB 

this is the hex byte (opcode) for this particular ASM code.

<p>

Now search for the bytes 750B8B4C242, the only byte we want to change 

in this string of numbers is 75 again. As before change it to EB. 

BEFORE YOU SAVE ANY FILE MAKE A BACKUP OF IT JUST INCASE. Now save 

the file (psp.exe) and run it.

** Enough said **

Well, I hope you understood it all and more than anything I hope it works (I 

know it does so don't worry!). This was written by a newbie as I said earlier 

and is meant to help the next generation of crackers become more knowledgeable
