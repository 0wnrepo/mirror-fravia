</I><HR>A "quick and dirty" look at <I> rhetoric </I> and 

<I> persuasion. </I><BR>by Kuririn<BR>12 December 1998<BR></CENTER>

 I think many among you will enjoy this small effort on my part, 

(leisure time is rapidly becoming scarcer for me :(<BR> 

Now friends let us look at just what is 

"persuasion" in the rhetorical sense... Persuasion is the art, primarily verbal, by which you get somebody (anybody)

to do what you want and make him at the same time, think this is what he/she had wanted to do all along. This does

not have to mean that the persuader has convinced the "puersuadee" to "do" anything, but perhaps to accept an 

opinion or adopt an attitude. So persuasion is the "engineering of consent." It is a way of exercising power

without increasing resentment.</I></CENTER>

<BR>

<P> <STRONG>Introduction </STRONG>: Regarding the destructive use of rhetoric: The only remedy is for as many people

as possible to learn something about how words work so that they will be armored against unscrupulous

attacks on their minds and on their pocketbooks. The best defense against being over-powered by the rabble-rouser

or bilked by the unethical advertiser is to become thoroughly aware of the power of words and to learn

to distinguish legitimate appeals from illegitimate ones.<P>







<P> <STRONG> Persuasion and Power </STRONG>: Persuasion represents power. Perhaps the highest compliment

ever paid the power of oratory, the prime form of persuasion in the world of ancient Greece and Rome,

is embodied in the story of the death of Cicero. After Mark Antony had caused Cicero to be assassinated,

and his head and hands were exposed in the Forum, Fulvia, Antony's wife, stuck a gold pin through the tongue

of the dead man to take vengeance on its power.<BR><BR>

Anyway if the desire for power was once the spur that drove the young (American, Frenchman, Greek &c)

to a study of classics, it still remains the fundamental motive for the exercise of persuasion. Today

such occasions are multiplied a thousand fold, but numerous as they are, they are lost in the more

massive manifestations  of persuasion that pour from printing presses crowd the television screens,

fill the airwaves, and blot out the landscape as our automobiles whirl down the highways. Demosthenes

and Cicero have been replaced as the masters of persuasion by courses in salesmanship and psychology,

charm schools, and other implementations of Dale Carnegie's famous formula "How to Win Friends and Influence

People."<BR><BR>

The engineering of consent is central to a democratic, industrial society. We live in the age of the

advertising man, propaganda expert, and motivation analyst. What was once a limited exercise is now

incessant and universal, and the stakes played for go higher every day.</P>



<P> <STRONG> Arguments and Persuasion (contrasting the two) </STRONG>: Argument and persuasion are often

lumped together, and their interrelation is indeed intimate. One cannot understand this interrelation

unless the two "terms" are sharply distinguished. It is true that people sometimes say, "I am not persuaded

of the truth of that argument." But in that case, they're using the word <I>persuade</I> (or the word

<I>argument</I>) in a more general sense then is intended (here in this context). <BR><BR>

The end of argument, strictly conceived is truth--truth as determined by the operation of reason. The end

of persuasion, on the other hand, is assent--assent to the will of the persuader. This distinction between

the end of the argument and that of persuasion is crucial, but to profit fully from it we must realize

another distinction. The end of argument is achieved <I>only one way</I>, by the operation of reason; but

the end of persuasion may be achieved in a <I>number of ways</I>, sometimes used singly, but more often

in combination. For instance, Aristotle, in his <I>Rhetoric</I>, remarks on three modes of persuasion,

the first dependent on the character and credibility of the persuader, the second on the persuader's

ability to stir emotions of those whom he aims to persuade, and the third on the proof of  "a truth or

an apparent truth."</P>





<P> <STRONG> Arguments and Persuasion (deeper analysis; identification) </STRONG>: We may say (returning again to

the differences between arguments and persuasion) that the characteristic end of each (arguments and

persuasion) implies a different germ situation. (<I>That from which anything springs; origin; first principle;

as, the germ of civil liberty.</I>) The germ situation out of which argument grows is doubt, and

argument us. involves some form of conflict. When conflict is involved in argument, the conflict

cannot be resolved unless those contending share some common ground; and the minimal requirement for

such a common ground is an agreement to accept the dictates of reason. In persuasion, on the contrary,

the persuader earnestly seeks to eliminate conflict from the germ situation, and if doubt exists he maintains

that it must be shared and resolved in a joint effort marked by mutual good will. Ther persuader's characteristic

assertion is that any difference between his point of view and that of the persuadee is the result of only

a slight misunderstanding that can readily be cleared up by a little friendly discussion, for they are two 

persons of <B> essentially identical interests </B>. In other words, what the persuader seeks is the broadest

possible common ground with the persuadee, something that goes far beyond the ground necessary for argument.

<B>Kenneth Burke</B> author of  <I>A Grammar of Motives</I> puts it this way  "You persuade a man only

in so far as you can talk his language by speech, gesture, tonality, order, image, attitude, idea,

<I>identifying</I> your ways with his." <I>Identification</I>, not conflict, is what the persuader seeks,

this is the key to his method (and understanding).</P>





<P> <STRONG> Arguments and Persuasion (deeper analysis; experiment) </STRONG>

The next time  you got to a public meeting on a controversial issue try to heckle the speaker. If he is

expert in his business, he will have diagnosed his audience and will know what attitude the majority

will take to your attack. If he thinks you have support, or feels that he has not yet found a sympathetic

relation with the audience, he will almost certainly say (something like): "Now that is a very good

question; let's try to think it through together." Or: "I'm glad you brought that up. Perhaps we can

pool our efforts and ..." OR: "That's an interesting way to go at the problem. I've been trying to 

state it, but you've done it so much better than I ever could." Even when the speaker feels that

he already has sympathetic relations with the audience, he may so value his roe as a conciliator

that he will pay you, the heckler, this deference. If on the other hand, he is secure in his

audience and chooses to answer your aggression with aggression of his own, trying wittily to make a

a fool of you for the delight of the public, he is still seeking identification with his audience

by provoking and entering into their sadistic pleasure in your humiliation.

<BR><BR> <STRONG> Identification 

(deeper analysis and support of fravia+ from Aristotle)</STRONG><BR>

The persuader cannot achieve identification or exploit the persuadee's relation to a group

unless he knows the audience. From the time of Aristotle's <I>Rhetoric</I> on, writers on

persuasion have tried to classify audiences with the hope of establishing <I> basic appeals.</I>

Aristotle made a basic (and particularly shrewd) classification by age (similar to fravia'+ claim).

The young, he said, are optimistic, energetic, brave, loyal, idealistic, quick to love or anger,

but they lack calculation, are prey to fads, have no steady goals, and overestimate their own

knowledge. The old are skeptical, suspicious, avaricious, dispassionate, comfort-loving, and doubtful

of aspiration. But men in the prime may combine the best qualities of youth and age. The important

idea here is that writers (throughout time) have suggested many such classifications ... which are

essential to the operations of publishing, advertising, public relations, and politics. An advertising

man makes classifications in relation to his product, and it is not likely that he will advertise

milk coates in a magazine concerned with poetry. Politicians temper their speeches to their audiences:

what might get applause in Boston might be suicide in the mid-west (you get the idea). Any "good" persuader

will instinctively classify his audience. (Note this well!)

An Addition, by Kuririn, 9 January 1999

</B><BR><BR>

/* some more "things" (it leaves out children) which by advertisers

standards are the best thing (due to their tax-free income and their 

developing need to spend and their inability to conceptualize money 

in general), nor does it mention single-parent families (divorce/death). I also

wanted to add in a couple of sections from Tocqueville (particulary)

"The taste for self-comfort in america" and better still "why the

americans are are often so restless in the midst of their prosperity" . but i

doubt it's very good to quote long from great authors (defies moderation). */

<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Aristotle's three modes of persuasion (deeper yet):</STRONG>

As stated before Aristotle's three modes of persuasion are (quoted again for your convenience) 



<UL>



<LI>dependent on the character and credibility of the persuader.</LI>

<LI>the persuader's ability to stir emotions of those whom he aims to persuade.</LI>

<LI>on the proof of  "a truth or an apparent truth.</LI>



</UL>





So having pointed out that Aristotle bases the first mode of persuasion on the character and credibility

of the persuader let's take a look at what this might mean. The persuader may have, of course, a prestige 

that precedes his utterance and predisposes the audience to accept him; but there is also the immediate

effect, the quality of the person on the platform, on the television screen, or behind the printed page.

If the personality of the persuader is not acceptable, identification will be granted grudgingly (if at all).

The courses in salesmanship echo Aristotle with brutal simplicity: <I>the first thing you have to sell

is yourself</I>. Over the centuries, vats of ink have been spilt analyzing this process, but common sense

remains the best guide. There are certain qualities that tend to detract from the appeal that the speaker

might have for most listeners or readers. The man will little self-confidence can expect to win little

confidence (from others). The man eaten up with self-adulation can expect little admiration. The man who 

does not respect others can expect little respect. The man who does not know his own mind can scarcely

control the minds of others. The man who cannot give sympathy rarely gets it (and so on).



<BR><BR>



The second mode of persuasion of Aristotle (and a look at <B>slanting and suggestion</B>). Cicero,

the master advocate, declared that all emotions "must be intimately known [by the orator], for

all the force and art of speaking as a persuader must be employed in allaying or exciting the feelings

of those who listen," This clearly, is where the arts of the propagandist, politician, advertising man 

--and even the poet-- intersect. This is the point, too, that most radically distinguishes persuasion

from argument... 

<BR>The answer lies in the psychical fact, long ago unearthed, that an emotion,

however aroused, seeks a justification and a target. The man who has an angry nature goes through life

seeking excuses for his anger and targets to vent it. The man with a loving heart, likewise, goes

about seeking justification and targets. Furthermore, emotional agitation makes a person vulnerable

to suggestion. "Emotional occasions," said William James, "especially violent ones, are extremely

potent in precipitating mental rearrangements." Thus the persuader, having worked up the emotion,

of whatever nature, goes on to provide the content suitable to his intentions; and this content

defines the target for the action he desires. Emotion always craves its appropriate fulfillment.

But the persuader may also work, and sometimes more effectively, with long-term emotional attitudes

that may represent desires and needs of which the persuadee may be scarcely conscious--or which he

may even deny. The advertisement for instance (an old advertisement) for the "expensive" Cadillac

(automobile) shoes the vehicle against the background of a baronial establishment, and the gloating 

owners are, of course, a young, elegant, and beautiful couple, almost as much in love with each other

as they are with the car :) Thus all the hidden, unrealistic yearnings of some balding, no-longer-young

but still minor executive--the yearnings for lost youth, good looks, fashion, social standing, ample means,

sexual conquest, and true love, and the need to express aggressive impulses on the highway with

350 horsepower--all flow together to guide the hand that signs the contract for the convenient time-payment

plan. What is most important (aside from cultivating your awareness of the psychological appeals of literature

and the potent effects of the technique of persuasion is to <I>constantly</I> scrutinize your own responses.

(Note this well!).<BR><BR>

<STRONG>Slanting and Suggestion</STRONG>: By slanting is meant the method by which,

without violating facts in any narrow sense, the persuader suggests such interpretations as are desired

by the persuader. Slanting can be seen in its crudest form in single words or phrases used for connotative

values. For example. Mr.(?) is, literally considered, a politician and a senator. The editorial of a newspaper

supporting him refers to him as a "statesman" or a "dedicated public servant." But an editorial in

an opposition newspaper prefers to call him a "party hack" or a "politico." The literal referent--Mr.(?)--

is the same in both cases, but the aura of connotation is, clearly not. And this leads us from the general

question of connotation in persuasion to that of metaphor; for metaphor, too, involves the "smuggling

in of emotion" and the control of responses. Let us take an example, the insult visited upon Edward Livingston,

an extremely able politician of the early 19th century, by John Randolph of Roanoke, another politician

and a famous wit. Livingston, said Randolph "is a man of splendid qualities, but utterly corrupt. Like rotten

mackerel, in the moonlight he shines and stinks." The insult covers Livingston's very reputation for 

brilliance into a liability. The brilliance becomes, in the metaphor, an index to the corruption: the same

rotting fish that shines also stinks --the putrescence that exudes adds to the glitter. And consider the

use of the word <I>moonlight</I>, which implies that the rotting fish would not seem so brilliant by

the light of day; then it would be recognized simply for what it is.



<BR><BR>



The third mode of persuasion and a <I>little bit more</I> then I'm done! The third being that of achieving assent by proving 

"a truth or an

apparent truth." First to the psychological phenomenon known as <I>rationalization</I> which provides a sort of bridge

between emotion in persuasion and logic in persuasion. Rationalization is the use of reason not to

seek truth but to <I>justify</I> desires, attitudes, belief, decisions, or actions already determined

on emotional grounds. In rationalization the forms of reason are used to work either or both of

two kinds of deception: <STRONG>to deceive the self or to deceive others </STRONG>. "Man cannot 

bear very much reality," (T.S Eliot --"Burnt Norton") and rationalization is man's built-in medicine

against reality. We live by self-flattering illusions and self-exculpating alibis. When we catch the ball,

we say: "Look, <I>I</I> caught the ball!" When we miss the ball, we say "My <I>hand</I> slipped." Furthermore,

we commonly live by decisions that we consider to be reasonably made and reasonably acted on, but that actually

are determined by motives that are unconscious, or that we choose to avoid considering. So rationalization

is characteristically <I>follows</I> actions, decision, attitude or belief. Its function is to make the past 

comfortable to live with. Its role is not to initiate but to justify ...To sum this thing up, what distinguishes

rationalization from valid reasoning is the <I>motive</I> from which it springs. Even a maniac may be faultlessly

logical in argument, but we have to his inspect his premises and his obsessions. (Right?). Now Aristotle held

that persuasion has not only to do with "truth," but with "apparent truth," and indeed the most obvious

connection of persuasion with logic is its connection with the distortions of logic that we call fallacies.

In studying persuasion, as in studying argument, one of the most fruitful fields to explore is that of

fallacies. With one difference however: in studying fallacies for argument, you study what you want to avoid

in your own argument and to detect in that of others; in studying them for persuasion you, study what, unless

you have moral scruples, you may sometimes profitably use. Certainly if you want to study fallacies in persuasion there

are a heap load examples in advertising, political speeches, sermons, and commencement addresses. (See at

top of page link to my links there is an address to a good page on common fallacies).<BR>



<BR><BR><STRONG>Finale</STRONG>

<BR><BR>

Within this century, there has been, as a result of technological development, and as a result of 

the concentration of financial control, a constant diminution of local and individual channels of expression

and debate. Furthermore, public relations experts have tended to narrow the ground of thought and debate--that

is, to fix key points that have immediate impact and propaganda value rather than long-range significance. Moreover,

<I>the experts tend to reduce differences between persons and platforms,</I> on the theory that in the clarification

of issues more persuasive power is lost then gained. For example, various observers have noted that the opinions

of candidates for office tend to get more alike as election day approaches. Also what is called the "image" of

a man is more important then the man himself or what he stands for, in politics or in other activities. Raymond

K. Price, one of the architects of President Nixon's election in 1968, is reported to have declared in the early

stages of the campaign that rational arguments would "only be effective if we get people to make the <I>emotional</I>

leap..." So the fundamental danger in the massive process of persuasion is the danger that all criteria of 

thought and judgement will be eroded or perverted, is most clearly revealed in what is called <I>saturation

techniques</I> which depend on slogans rather than ideas, repetition rather than discussion, on hypnosis rather

than awareness. This danger to thought and judgement is, of course, aggravated by the contempt for , or at

least condescension toward, the public that characterizes at least a segment of the professional persuaders,

and attitude fairly well indicated by the following remarks of the Whitaker of the famous public relations

firm of Whitaker and Baxter:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

The average American, when you catch him after hours, as we must, doesn't want to be educated; he doesn't want

to improve his mind; he doesn't want to work, consciously, at being a good citizen. But there are two ways

you can interest him in a campaign, and only two that we have ever found successful. Most every American loves

a <I>contest</I>...So <I>you can interest him if you put on fight...</I> Then, too, most every American likes

to be entertained. He likes the movies, he likes mysteries; he likes fireworks and parades...So if you can't fight

, <B>PUT ON A SHOW!</B>... (Patrick Marsh: <I>Persuasive Speaking</I>) 

</BLOCKQUOTE><BR>



On a last note...Aldous Huxley pointed out,

in the early optimism engendered by general literacy and a free press, people were naive enough to believe that there were 

only two kinds of propaganda, the true and the false. They "did not foresee what in fact has happened, above all in

our Western capitalist democracies--the development of a vast mass communication industry, concerned in the main

neither with the truth nor the false, but with the unreal, the more or less totally irrelevant." And it might

also be added that, in the end, the contempt for, or condescension toward, the public affects the public's own view of

itself; it becomes cynical toward its own opinions, more or less dimly realizing that those opinions may be a product

of manipulation and are lacking in both intellectual and moral content. SO the final contempt, and condescension, is to

assume that it does not matter by what process assent is achieved if the assent is to a "good" thing--a good

product,show,firm,candidate, or idea. (AND now-a-days commercials don't even take this approach...n.b., the

television commercial of the kid who receives his first paycheck (at a fast food restaurant) and while his boss

is praising his success of a well worked week, and his future potential (he realizes that the check is just

enough to cover a nintendo (or some game) and quits.) Now the process doesn't matter nor does the assent, heh.
