do I set breakpoints and all that?</CENTER>

<BR> 





This has been for obvious reasons the most important project of the +HCU, 

and I'm glad to say that we have <FONT color=red>TERMINATED</FONT> it in 

less than four months. BOZO's Phase 8, that I'm publishing to-day (2 August 1997), 

represents the final point for the protection scheme of the NT version. 

<FONT color=red>Does it? See Phase 9 by Birdy Harry and Phase A by ViceVersa+</FONT>!!

<BR><BR>

Anyway, I would like to thank <FONT color=blue>the guys of Numega</FONT> for their wonderful debugger, 

a tool that I have used with passion and love since its DOS version 2.6 (cracked and distributed by the 

Marquis de Soiree), a software debugger so powerful that Numega's <U>hardware</U> 

concurrence (Periscope) 

went bust! I hope the Numega guys  

will improve Softice even more in the future, if possible, for once, 

not only in order to facilitate debugging with source code available 

(which has for us zero interest! And stupid programmers leaving 

stupid bugs in their overbloated source code can use simpler -and equally stupid- debuggers) but also 

for more noble and difficult reverse engineering purposes (which has an enormous 

interest for the whole future evolution of the software industry out of the mortal "embrace" of Micro$oft), 

and I hope as well that they will learn here 

how to protect better their invaluable product.<BR>

I believe it is appropriate to remember here the names of the Godot developers:<BR>

<PRE>Dom Basile      Wizard extraordinaire   	

Tom Guinther    Symbol engine, loader   	

Dan Babcock     Symbol engine   	

Gerald Ryckman  Win95 porting & debugging   	

Ray Hsu         Video & mouse support</PRE> 



Let's also send a greeting to <FONT color=red>Cathy Philbrick</FONT>, Numega's main "scarecrow 

spammer", here it is:<FONT color=purple><PRE>

Dear Cathy, I have received your spam, sent on 9/9/97. Unfortunately your email 

was a little imprecise: 

  	this site is NOT "distributing your products on the Web", legally 

  or illegaly. In fact there is absolutely no need to distribute them 

  even more. There has never been such a need: the "Bonamico" copy is 

  everywhere and Numega itself has recently distributed all its products to 

  the world with a "trial" protection so silly that one wonders if you 

  actually WANTED your products distributed to every looser for free 

  (as if, I repeat, it would have been difficult to find complete pirated

  copies of any Numega product on the Net... there was NO NEED to reverse 

  engineer your trial in order to have a perfect complete working copy 

  of whatever product you have... we have done it just for the fun!). 

       I'll speak only for my own site: not a single copy of your product 

  has been distributed from this pages where, on the countrary, I have 

  always publicly written that people should even "buy" your product.

  This by the way is jolly nice of us, since in the reality -I repeat- 

  your prouct can be gathered everywhere (but here) for free... yes kids, 

  even version 3.2... I just did a stupid ftpsearch and found two of 

  them :-)

  You write also that you "monitor illegal sites frequently" (Gee... I 

  would really love to have a job like that!). 

  Well, you do not seem to be very well informed.

  This is NOT an illegal site. Reverse engineering is NOT illegal. 

  Protection busting is NOT illegal. Removing protections from a 

  target that you have legally obtained (bought, or as shareware, or

  as "trial ware, like your programs), is NOT illegal. Screwing or 

  re-writing or modifiyng or nuking, or hitting with a mace alien 

  code is NOT illegal... 

  It's exactly what your own researchers, at Numega, are doing all 

  the time, ask them, watch them, grow up for God's sake. And since 

  you are at it, Cathy, you may as well ask them why the hell are 

  complete unprotected registered versions of ALL Numega's products

  being kept on your own public anonymous FTP server, another of the 

  many facts that you don't seem to be aware of.

        I'll now repeat to you, Cathy, what I have always written yet

  -alas- you do not seem to have never read (which is <FONT color=red>bad</FONT>, since I 

  believe that there are not many sites on the web where Numega gets 

  so much real feedback -and so much praise- as here at fravia's... 

  therefore you are probably NOT doing your "monitoring" job very well, 

  dear Cathy, time to fire you, may be) here it is: 

  Anybody that is seriously into reverse engineering should BUY 

  softice (as I have done long ago) and THEN crack it black and 

  blue. 

  Anyway I'll monitor your site frequently to ensure compliance 

  with reality.

                              Fravia</PRE></FONT>

In name of the +HCU I would like to thank in particular Frog's print and +Rcg. First of all Frog's print, mon ami, if it were not for you 

all this would not have been possible. Frog's print and +Rcg have supplied the "Backbone" 

of this Project.<BR>My thanks, and the thanks of the whole 

scene go also to IgNorAMUS, Birdy Harry, The Undertaker, Bozo and ViceVersa+. 

Each one of these Authors 

has given valuable input and decisive help to this project.<BR>

<BR>

Project2 is CONCLUDED, long life to Winice!<BR><BR><CENTER>

<FONT size=+2>ADDS-ON</FONT>  <BR>            

And yet we had to add some "adds-on": Numega continues to give 

out "trial" versions of beautiful programs 

with incredibly silly protection schemes...  (and yes, Numega continues 

to publish complete 

registered versions of them on its own ftp server as well, btw :-)

<BR><BR>In fact the problem is not how to find a fully functional, registered and working 

copy of ANY Numega's software whatsoever (every version is roaming 

the Web). The real funny question for us is: "Why does Numega use such 

stupid protection schemes inside his "protected" versions?".

Mind you, we are not speaking of a small shareware programmer that is using 

some overbloated language for some overbloated useless application: we are speaking 

of the BEST programmers and wizards of assembly in the whole planet here! 

And yet they protect as if they had just finished their copy of "teach yourself assembly 

language in 5 easy lessons".

<BR>

The fact that Numega (which, differently 

from 

Micro$oft lamers' park, HAS INDEED A LOT of said good programmers and 

wizards) publishes powerful disassembly and reversing tools (Bondcheck, 

Smartcheck, Softice...) in  

downlodable "trial" version with 

pretty silly protections (as if the kind of people that REALLY USE such tools 

were not capable of earing a password echo in memory), added to the 

fact that they "forget" complete versions of their programs on their 

own ftp servers (Softice for Win95 3.2 has been there for more than 

two months now :-) can IMO only mean 

two things:<BR><BR>

A) EITHER Numega follows the Micro$oft path of giving away everything 

for free, in the hope that they will dominate the disassembler 

"commercial" 

markt and get the rewards from "scale" economy.<BR>

This may happen: crackers and "simple" programmers 

of to-day, 

i.e. a great part of the people that peruse sites like mine (of which, I am afraid, 

there are MANY available that offer just the cracks and no explanation 

at all), ARE the reverse 

engineers of to-morrow (who else?), and will be able to afford *any*   

"commercial" fare that Numega will in the future decide for, say, 

Smartcheck version 13.0.<BR>

B) OR that Numega will bring to light a very tough protections (the mytical 

"unbreakable" software protection :-) as soon as their absolute dominance 

of the market has been asserted. Let's hope they do it as early as possible: the "protections"

 (if you really want to call them so) that they 

are using at the moment are simply too boring to bother<BR><BR>

<I>An important lesson, deepens our undesrtanding of NT-Winice.<BR>

About this phase I got a comment from Squirrle:</I>

<BR>

</CENTER><PRE>

Phase six was only partly helpful in patching ntice.  

I got lots of errors and even after I found out about the need for 

certain visual c++ libraries to follow phase 4.  Since I could not 

load pnpisa.sys as described (error requesting some debug data) 

I could not get the new checksum.  

My version was different than in phase six so I was not able to copy 

the work.  I did some searching on the net and found a helpful news 

article describing how to AUTOMATICALLY change the checksum.  

Simple (although not as instructive, it WORKS) use vc++ editbin.exe 

as follows:  editbin /release <DRIVER.sys>  That's it.  

You'll need editbin.exe, link.exe and mspdb40.dll from vc++ v4 

(I got a cheapie copy from a store selling an old standard version 

under a different name).  

Perhaps this would help some newbies get up and running faster -- 

NT is not an easy thing to understand without some good training!  

Thanks for all the good information and keep up the good work!



Squirlle, 25 July 1997</PRE><I>

The problem addressed by Squirlle is discussed (and resolved) in BOZO's 

PHASE 8... read that and look... it's an interesting history... Winice for WinNT "changes" 

if loaded at Boot or afterwards... anybody would like to delve a little 

inside this particular aspect?

everything once more and presenting a "final" nice product of the +HCU to the
