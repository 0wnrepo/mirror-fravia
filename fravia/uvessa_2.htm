bypassing the WriteProcessMemory and a lot of other goodies... (I love

Uncle Van's approach: <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">&quot;there will be really &quot;man

Well, this is the greatest discussion nowadays, concerning 

the software protection - Is it possible under such &quot;allmighty&quot; 

OS like windo$e (but also all other protected mode systems) to 

write into one's own code in order to protect his product against 

(banal) patches and unexpirienced cracker? 

<BR>It's first necessary to know about memory protection, that 

Intel's x86 line has two general modes - real and protected - and 

furthermore in protected mode it can operate in 4 security 

&quot;rings&quot; - ring 0 till ring 3. 

<BR>Every ring corresponds to an appropriate privilege level 

- the higher the number the lower the privilege level. This means, 

that p.e. in ring 0 ALL opcodes are allowed and there is no 

restriction in the terms of memory access, it's just like in old 

&quot;real&quot; DOS, you can rampage everything you fancy ;=D. 

<BR>But as you walk to the higher ring number more and more 

restrictions appears: several opcodes get disabled, you are not 

allowed to acces memory regions you not own, IN and OUT instructions 

are getting &quot;controlled&quot;, and at least, you can't even write to your 

own code segments because it is write protected too. (Here I'm not 

so sure!) 

<BR>You can &quot;jump&quot; from a ring with higher privilege to code in 

rings with lower privilege, but not vice versa. 

<BR>In the windo$e world applications run of course in the ring 

3 mode ;-(, while the main part of the OS itself AND the drivers 

(Vxd!) operate at ring 0. And as we already know from Fravias page, 

overwriting the own code is essential for a good protection. 

The most cool protections BTW were made in DOS real-mode times, 

some of them are not cracked yet! 

<BR>The main problem is how could a program overwtite its own code 

on such OS? At this point I'll qoute +rcg from his First 

Attempt:http://fravia.org/pro_rcg.htm 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">&quot;.........  VxD. I know this is a big effort, but I'm sure we

will be able to program them in a few months, so we will take

again the control over the system (just like we did in Ms-Dos).&quot;</FONT></PRE>

It must be really a big effort since we didn't hear something 

new about this ;-) You can read Fravia's essay about VxDs too 

in order to get a first impression about such a stuff. 

<BR>I'll show you here how the guys from Mijenix solved this 

problem. </TD>

<P>These are indeed a couple of utilities inluding an OLE container designed

for the &quot;power user&quot; ;-) to maintain your desktop tasks etcetera. I'm concentrated

on a program named Pdexplo.exe, an advanced explorer. I don't use such

kind of stuff but some among you seem to like it (thanks Stefan for the

interesting request!). 

<BR>This a evaluating version and is limited to 30 day period. Then it

starts a &quot;grace&quot; period of 10 days or so during that the user is supposed

to realize what he is going to loose soon (also by playing sad songs to

him!)- a new professional &quot;enslavement&quot; trick; look at Fravia's Enslavement

techniques page. 

<BR>The program creates some keys in the registry where the date of the

installation is stored and proofs the current date on the system files

(user.dat), you can check this by yourself, there is nothing unconvenient

there. 

<BR>You can easily find the protection code in the memory with SoftIce:

By slightly rejumping it we can start the target regardless of expired

dates and periods, but the attempt to locate the checks with hexeditor

or Wdasm fails. Disassembling the program we see at the above addresses:

Really tough, eh? 

<BR>Which tricks they have used to hide the real code until program start?

The right assumption is that this piece of code is somewhere in the data

area and is evntl. decoded and &quot;paste&quot; in the right place at run time. 

<BR>How they do it? 

<BR>Looking at the imported functions we see some with very meaningfull

names like: 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">...............

KERNEL32.GetCurrentProcess

KERNEL32.GetCurrentProcessId

KERNEL32.OpenProcess

KERNEL32.ReadProcessMemory

KERNEL32.WriteProcessMemory

...............</FONT></PRE>

What you say? These could be the ones! 

<BR>According to micro$oft manuals a process is a &quot;fundamental&quot; term in

their(!) OS and 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">&quot;..when You start a program from the disk it becames a process.&quot;</FONT></PRE>

Aha! And in fact you can do many things with a process - getting its handle,

opening it, reading from its memory AND WRITING TO IT, if you have the

necessary rights; but when you <B><I>own</I></B> a process you have all

rights as well! 

<BR>So we BPX ReadProcessMemory in SoftIce and load the target. And BINGO!

I think this is clear enough: The firs few Reads are dealing with the &quot;hidden&quot;

piece of code - reading and decoding it. The culprite in this scheme is

the last Read, just before the final Write: It reads from the area where

the code should be placed in and stores it in a buffer in memory (see your

help reference for the parameters passed to both functions). Before the

Write we have at memory location 00445000 following &quot;code salad&quot;:

Then the call at 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">0137:0043A128  E823FEFFFF          CALL    00439F50</FONT></PRE>

reads the data FROM THE BUFFER and checks it against patches. The same

routine uses some of the values there as pointers for further reads so

when you change something in the .EXE the program crashes immediately due

to an ugly PF. More on, a lot of jump-tables are set among the checks there

accordingly to the read piece of code, which are necessary for the proper

work of the program. 

<H3>

Preprocessing the target</H3>

Now we have to summarize our approach: The idea is that cracking the protection

itself should be rather banal and we can leave it for some later point.

What we need first is to &quot;fix&quot; the code there and preserve it from the

final Write, since it would destroy all our patches. This is a kind of

&quot;crack before the crack&quot; which I called Precrack ;-). After that, you can

analize it in a more relaxed way, maybe with your favorite cocktail in

your hand... 

<BR>To do this we can crack the check routine itself in order to make it

set the jump tables and then bypass the WriteProcessMemory; this would

probably work, but there are lots of checks, it would be the hell to trap

them and we can never be sure that we have fixed them all. 

<BR>It is allways better when we have to do with such complex encoding/decoding

algorithms to try to fool them, making them believe that everything is

OK, while our crack lurks in the background... This decreases the risk

of evntl. further side effects too. 

<BR>In this case I choosed following approach: 

<UL TYPE="DISC">

<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">we paste the decoded protection functions at their

&quot;native&quot; location - 44400h in the .EXE or 00445000h in the process image

(in memory at run time)</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">we copy the original content of that same location

somewhere else in the .EXE</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">we pass then a pointer to the new location to the

ReadProcessMemory function; since the check routine reads from the buffer,

it should work properly and set the jumps for us just as if in the normal

case</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">then we bypass the WriteProcessMemory and</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">...crack at least the &quot;preserved&quot; protection in some

conventional way</FONT></LI>

</UL>

Now lets go one after another. 

<BR>First we need of course the binary image of the protection scheme.

This is best done with softice - we bpx at WriteProccesMemory and right

after it we issue: 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">d 004450000 L 1C5F</FONT></PRE>

since we know that the code is already there at this point. Then GO and

back in the SoftIce Loader we choose &quot;safe history to file&quot;. The hexdump

of the memory with the protection is now in some file, p.e. dump.txt by

me. 

<BR>Now comes right the next problem: In the dump we have something like

this:

but this is still the ASCII representation of the memory content and we

need it to be encoded back in bin format. Since no one of the HexEditors

known by me offers such a feature like importing ASCII dump (or exporting

its screen content to ASCII) we must help us ourself. I did it (once more!)

for you this time. I modified the Skeleton program by Barry Kauler from

his book <I>Windows Assembly Language and Systems Programming</I> (BTW

a very interesting example of programing for windo$e in pure Assembly,

you should study it!) by adding a menu item (Convert), a button with tooltip

for it, some code to perform the convertion (Convert.asm) and named it

<A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/3116/hexer.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/3116/hexer.zip'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/3116/hexer.zip">Hexer</A>. 

<BR>When you open a file the hexer reads its content in a buffer and when

you press convert it converts it from ASCII dump in binary with consecutive

saving it with the extension &quot;bin&quot;. The Hexer filters the input, thus throwing

any characters that appear not to be a hex digit, otherwise it packs the

consecutive hex digits pair-alike in a byte. 

<BR>However you must strip both columns with the address information and

the ASCII dump from your file, leaving this way only the relevant hex part

in the middle; the hexer then takes care of the spaces and other non binary

characters(-). You need for this a good TextEditor which allows block selecting,

the <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.textpad.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.textpad.com/'" tppabs="http://www.textpad.com/">TextPad from Helios</A> is such a

tool. 

<BR>After doing all this you should have a file named XXX.bin which contains

the whole protection scheme as it appears in the memory after the Write. 

<BR>Now lets look for a place for the original code at that location -

from 00445000 to 00446C60 (or 44400h to 46060h in the EXE), which, as we

know is relevant for the checks before that. 

<BR>With some experimenting you can see that the routine checks indeed

only the non- zeroed part of it, these are 0E8Ah bytes of code - from 44400h

to 4528Ah in the exe. From the bottom line in the code window in SoftIce

we know that this section is called .etext and with pdump.exe we find out

that it is 1E00 bytes long: 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">.............

  02 .etext    VirtSize: 00001C4B  VirtAddr:  00045000

    raw data offs:   00044400  raw data size: 00001E00

    relocation offs: 00000000  relocations:   00000000

    line # offs:     00000000  line #'s:      00000000

    characteristics: 60000020

      CODE  MEM_EXECUTE  MEM_READ

.............</FONT></PRE>

The Virtual address above concerns the adresses in the process address

space - when the program is loaded in memory (at run time), while the RAWs

show the ofsets in the EXE file. 

<BR>For our example we should need 1C4B+E8A=2AD5h bytes which goes beyond

the .etext section's border. Right after the .etext is the data section

what means that we cannot paste the E8Ah bytes content without destroying

the data there. 

<BR>What to do? Shold we give up? 

<BR>Not at all! We must simply extend a section to the desired value. 

<BR>This brings right two other problems: <B><I>Which section</I></B> should

we extend, and <B><I>how to adjust the PE header</I></B> in order for the

EXE to be properly loaded after that? 

<BR>The .etext is the second section and there are still 5 of them, what

means, when wee manipulate the size of the .etext we have to adjust all

other that comes behind it which would be a hell job. So we look for the

LAST section in this executable which happens to be the .reloc one: 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">.............

  07 .reloc    VirtSize: 0000572A  VirtAddr:  00072000

    raw data offs:   0006A800  raw data size: 00005800

    relocation offs: 00000000  relocations:   00000000

    line # offs:     00000000  line #'s:      00000000

    characteristics: 42000040

      INITIALIZED_DATA  MEM_DISCARDABLE  MEM_READ

............</FONT></PRE>

As we can see it has 572A bytes initialized data (data we should NOT touch!)

and is at offset 6A8000 in the file. With our piece of code the size increases

to: 

<PRE>        <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">572A+0E8A=65B4h</FONT></PRE>

what we round up to 6600h (must be so for systems reason) for both virtual

and raw size. The offset in the EXE where we should place our code is calculated

so: 

<PRE>        <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">6A800+572A=6FF2Ah</FONT></PRE>

coze the actual data ordinals in the segment run from 0 to 5729h. 

<BR>What leaves is the new virtual address that we will pass to the ReadProcessMemory

function. We calculate it so: 

<PRE>        <FONT COLOR="#0000FF">VirtAddr+OldVirtSize+ImageBase </FONT><FONT COLOR="#000000">what means:

</FONT><FONT COLOR="#0000FF">        72000+572A+400000=47772Ah</FONT></PRE>

We proceed further so: 

<UL>

<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Open the Pdexplo.exe with your Hexeditor and go to

location 44400h (Virt 445000)</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Copy the content from 44400h to 4528A (E8A bytes,

one less or more is not so relevant!)</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Go to location 6FF2A (this should the .reloc section)

and insert the copied bytes there; be sure to NOT only OVERWRITE the old

content in the .reloc - Hedit and HexWorkShop have different behavior at

this point!</FONT></LI>



<LI>

<FONT COLOR="#0000FF">Go back to 44400h and REPLACE the 1CF5 bytes there

with our .bin file made by the Hexer</FONT></LI>

</UL>

Now it is time for the second problem. 

<BR>We have to adjust the size of the .reloc in order to avoid wrong file

format complain by the loader and to make sure the WHOLE new segment will

be loaded. For this we open the Pdexplo.exe with the Hexeditor and search

for the string &quot;.reloc&quot;. There are two occurences, the first in the header,

right at the beginning of the exe, and the second where the actual segment

starts. We need the first one since there the size and the offset are stored: 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">..............

00000260  00 00 00 40 00 00 40 2E 72 65 6C 6F 63 00 00  ....@..@.reloc..

00000270  2A 57 00 00 20 07 00 00 58 00 00 00 A8 06 00  *W... ...X......

..............</FONT></PRE>

One can easely see where both - virtual and raw - data size are stored

(in reverse order!): at 00000270 - Raw Size; and 00000277 - Virtual Size.

So we must change them so: 

<PRE><FONT COLOR="#800080">..............

00000260  00 00 00 40 00 00 40 2E 72 65 6C 6F 63 00 00  

00000270  00 66 00 00 20 07 00 00 66 00 00 00 A8 06 00  

..............</FONT></PRE>

I didn't adjust the data size coze it runs so, but you can do it if you

have any loader problems, you can find it after the PE initials. 

<BR>Now to the next problem. To make all work properly we must pass our

new offset to the ReadProcessMemory. Lets look at the code there:

You see that the address to read from is passed via the stack. The stack

points in this section of code to a region with useful system info about

the exe, the hell knows how this data get there! We don't want to crack

deeper so we change it to:

0137:0043A0DA  8B542420            MOV     EDX,[ESP+20]

0137:0043A0E3  52                  PUSH    EDX ; &lt;== Count, doesn't matter!

0137:0043A0E4  50                  PUSH    EAX

0137:0043A0EB  FF1574174500        CALL    [KERNEL32!ReadProcessMemory]

............</FONT></PRE>

and everything will be OK. 

<BR>You haven't forgotten that we have to bypass the WriteProcessMemory

function too, since we don't want it to overwrite our decoded protection

with the future cracks there. In the original we have:

Now you can start the modified target and if you did everything OK it should

present to you its usual screen.

is on my site the full <FONT COLOR="#0000FF"><A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/3116/uvpack.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/3116/uvpack.zip'" tppabs="http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/Delta/3116/uvpack.zip">uvpack.zip</A></FONT>:

Recapitulation:</H3>

Which conclusions can we make from this protection? 

<BR>Well, they are getting better. This target is even harder to crack

as some dongle protected ones. We still got the advantage of the assembly

and cracking knowledge we obtained from our gurus, but there is only one

little step remaining to the modifying &quot;on the fly&quot;, I wonder how they

didn't make it yet; and they should, if they have read thoroughly enough

Fravias page... ;-) the solution is shown there months ago! 

<BR>Then we will have to do with fully different protection techniques

and at the end there will be really &quot;man against man&quot;, I see glorious days

coming...

I've done it for first in Oct, then when I wrote the essay in mid. November

and there were still the same addresses as shown in the essay. The autor

hadn't at this time a www page, so we can never be sure which the actual

<TD BGCOLOR="#C0C0C0"><A name="anchoradda"><FONT size="+2">Marigold's add-on</FONT> (16 January 1998)<BR>

<I>This is the second part of a very interesting letter by Marigold. The first 

part deals with Timelock 3 protections and can be 

read <A href="marigold.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/marigold.htm">here</A>. I received it on 16 January 1998</I>

<PRE>

I confess now that the real reason to write this letter was the 

essay by Uncle Van on Mijenix's target. I love Mijenix 

protections! I cannot forget the acute pleasure their cracking 

gave me! So, it is jealousy after all... 

Uncle Van is wrong at least in one point: This program has a 

history. For +ORC student it is quite a mistake...



For me this history began with version 2.0, installed by 

Pdeval20.exe. I think this version, though obsolete, is still 

available. Its protection is as follows: application creates a 

temporary file pdthkxx.tmp, decrypts and writes into it a .dll 

code. Then it does LoadLibrary and GetProcAddress for all four 

exported functions in it. Nothing special till now... The real 

trick is that a call to one of the functions is inside the 

message loop of the application. And this function contains 

TranslateMessage and DispatchMessage, so it actually closes the 

loop (only if all checks are satisfied). What to do? Patching of 

encrypted DLL's code is unpractical, if only possible... Other 

calls to protection functions are avoidable and the only real 

problem is how to close the message loop. So, let's close it! The 

application itself does not import TranslateMessage and 

DispatchMessage; thus necessary steps include:

1 GetModuleHandle for USER32,

2 GetProcAddress for TranslateMessage and DispatchMessage,

3 Create a short function which calls them and 

4 Redirect call inside a message loop to this new function. 



PowerDesk Suit includes five executables; in all cases &quot;gross 

weight&quot; of patching does not exceed ~100 bytes, and we have a lot 

of space to do it as we do not need now all that protectionist&#146;s 

junk which creates and runs temporary DLL.



A new generation of Mijenix's products (PowerDesk upgrades to 

versions 2.0x, ZipMagic 1.0 Trial) uses &quot;improved&quot; protection. 

Now it does not create a temporary DLL but decrypts a part of 

application code &quot;in flight&quot;. (As rightly described in Uncle's 

Van essay.) All other features of protection preserved intact! So 

why shouldn't we use the same solution as before? The 

installation procedure for PowerDesk upgrade to version 2.0x 

checks (in its &quot;secret&quot; part) if the previous version is not 

trial but purchased. If so, it continues (and closes the message 

loop). So, it is all the same but easier to crack because this 

application imports TranslateMessage and DispatchMessage 

(steps 1 and 2 of above are unnecessary here). Patching 

in this case is only ~20 bytes long. It is longer for two 

ZipMagic's executables but quite similar. 



Once having been understood, Mijenix's trick does not look 

very tough either, but I would rather place it higher than 

the tricks of TimeLock 3.03.



I hope this letter will be of some interest to you. And, please, 

don't call my favorite approach &quot;brute force&quot;. It is not brute, 

as applications work better after that... they do not need to do 

many foolish things.



     Many kisses,



      Marigold.
