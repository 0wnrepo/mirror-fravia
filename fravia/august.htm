poetry and novels, collect medusae, sail and swim...  

I do not intend to access the web, that's sure)<BR>

You may contact +gthorne (he has the keys to my site) for 

urgent matters. Please don't write to me unless necessary, my email addresses repositories 

will anyway -as usual- explode during August, since I will definitely NOT access them (it's 

holydays, comprehendes? :-)<BR>OK, this said, if you write to me anyway, or want to send 

some important 'can't wait' stuff, please  by all means USE the 

rotating addresses that you'll find in due time on 

my <A href="info.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/info.htm">info.htm</A> page, DO NOT use any of my older email addresses!<BR><BR>

Thanks, have a good month (and write some great essays!) see you all on the beach (or back here in 

September :-)<BR>
