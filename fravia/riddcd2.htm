<I>Well, Riddler is slowly &quot;specialising&quot; in this very interesting 

cracking subject! Here is his SECOND essay in a very short time. 

Let's hope he keeps sending material, as I will 

repeat (once more): &quot;I hope that with the help of this addition many 

+crackers will be stimulated and work on such schemes, bringing ahead 

this poor and neglected (yet important) project 4</I>!&quot;

How to Crack MechWarrior2 Mercenaries

(Another Approach to the Cd-Check scheme)

</FONT><FONT size="+1">

by +-=Riddler=-+ </FONT></CENTER>



	This is a well known game and should be widely availible from 

the internet. I personally purchased this game. I played it for a bit

and then I discarded it into the box with the rest of my cd's. I tired

of it and it was in a way a waste of my money. But it makes a good 

program to write a tutorial on due to the fact that it can be widely

found and also that I am going to approach this program and also 

sucessfully crack it. 



	Ok, as usual let's get down to business. MechWarrior2 Mercenaries 

is a 3-D fighting game and is well known. Even if you do a FULL INSTALL

at 150MB, it still requires the cd to start. This kind of protection is 

in effect controling the consumer. I personally beleive that if you pay

$55 for a game like I did, that you should be at least able to play 

against a friend over a network or modem or whatever. But in a case like

this that means you would need 2 cd's, to play like, that or more depending

on the number of players.



	Ok, now this cd comes with 2 versions on it. It has a Windows95

version of the program and a DOS version of the program. In this case 

we are going to crack the protection in the Windows95 Version. Now if 

you read my essay on the WarLords3 Cd-Check crack we where able to make

the program jump to the good code to continue no matter what the procedure 

GetLogicalDrives returned with, a success or a failure. 

So in this case instead of making it jump wheather it is a sucess or a 

failure, we are going to approach it another way and that being the fact 

that we are going to change where it looks for the file. 

I am going to walk through it and this, for example, maybe an easier

way to crack a cd-check because say for example you have a program that will 

acutually verify the file, (which this one doesn't) you can copy that file

to the harddisk and tell it to look there. 

That way if it needs data to run off the cd, it can

still get the data and it won't really require the cd to run. 

That's how we are going to crack this program.  



	Ok, I began this crack by loading &quot;mercswin.exe&quot; into w32dsm 

and I decompiled it. Ok now I decided to start off looking in the dissembled 

text for &quot;GetLogicalDrives&quot; because as we all know is a well used function 

to begin to verify a cd-rom. 

Along with with &quot;GetLogicalDrives&quot; you can also have several others such

as &quot;GetDriveType&quot; and &quot;GetLogicalDriveStrings&quot;. 

It turns out that &quot;GetLogicalDrives&quot; is not used in this program at all, 

but searching for it, it brought me to &quot;GetLogicalDriveStrings&quot; and in 

this case it's right where we need and want to be. 

Ok, so this is the code that we find when we search for 

&quot;GetLogicalDriveStrings&quot;:



* Reference To: KERNEL32.GetLogicalDriveStringsA, Ord:00E5h

                                  |

:00401036 FF1568B14000            Call dword ptr [0040B168]

:0040103C 8D442410                lea eax, dword ptr [esp+10]



* StringData Ref from Data Obj -&gt;&quot; :\OLD_MERC.DRV&quot;  &lt;--This is the file verified

                                  |

:00401040 6838804000              push 00408038

:00401045 50                      push eax

:00401046 E875090000              call 004019C0

:0040104B C7053480400000000000    mov dword ptr [00408034], 00000000

:00401055 83C408                  add esp, 00000008

:00401058 803F00                  cmp byte ptr [edi], 00

:0040105B 7442                    je 0040109F



Ok that we know the file that the program is going to look for...Let's

scroll down some and take a careful look at the code that follows:





* Reference To: KERNEL32.FindFirstFileA, Ord:0079h

                                  |

:0040105D 8B3574B14000            mov esi, dword ptr [0040B174] &lt;--Load offset of

                                                                   filename 

* Reference To: KERNEL32.GetDriveTypeA, Ord:00CEh

                                  |

:00401063 8B2D64B14000            mov ebp, dword ptr [0040B164]



* Referenced by a Jump at Address:00401094(C)

|

:00401069 53                      push ebx

:0040106A FFD5                    call ebp       &lt;--Call GetDriveTypeA Function  

:0040106C 83F805                  cmp eax, 5     &lt;--Is Drive CD-Rom?????

:0040106F 751D                    jne 0040108E   &lt;--IF it's not get cd-rom

:00401071 8D4C2424                lea ecx, dword ptr [esp+24] 

:00401075 FF0534804000            inc dword ptr [00408034]

:0040107B 8A03                    mov al, byte ptr [ebx]

:0040107D 51                      push ecx

:0040107E 88442414                mov byte ptr [esp+14], al

:00401082 8D442414                lea eax, dword ptr [esp+14]

:00401086 50                      push eax

:00401087 FFD6                    call esi

:00401089 83F8FF                  cmp eax, FFFFFFFF &lt;--Does Function Fail?

:0040108C 750A                    jne 00401098      &lt;--If it doesn't continue



Now before we do anything else with the program we are going to concentrate on

one thing and that being the fact that the &quot;cmp eax,00000005&quot; at Code Offset

&quot;0040106C&quot;. Let's Review the Properties of &quot;GetDriveTypeA&quot;



GetDriveTypeA Return Function codes:



Value               Meaning

0                 Drive Cannot Be determined

1                 Root Dir Does not exist

2                 DriveRemoveable

3                 A Fixed Disk (HardDrive)  

4                 Remote Drive(Network)

5                 Cd-Rom Drive

6                 RamDisk



Ok now when &quot;eax&quot; is compared to &quot;5&quot; it is just seeing that the drive 

it has found is indeed a cd-rom. 

Ok Break out Hiew and load up &quot;mercswin.exe&quot; and we are going 

to goto the offset of the &quot;cmp eax, 5&quot; we can see that is at offset 

&quot;046Ch&quot; now we are going to change that 5 in the instruction to a &quot;3&quot; 

that way it will look for a HardDrive instead of a Cd-Rom. 

Ok, so save that change and then stop a second and think. 

OK, we have patched the code and it should work but there

is still the manner of &quot;:\OLD_MERC.DRV&quot; ok so we know that 

it will look at it in the root dir of the drive. 

In this case the drive where &quot;mercswin.exe&quot; installed to.

Ok so create a file &quot;OLD_MERC.DRV&quot; in the root dir. 

Now after you have done that go and try to run &quot;mercswin.exe&quot; and 

you will see that is works without a hitch.

The program will fire right up. This program simply checks for the 

presence of the file but does not verify it's contents nor does it 

verify its date, size, time, attributes or anything of that nature. 

Now we can run the program without the cd by changing one byte in 

the file. 

I have seen a crack for this before, published by the PhroZen Crew. 

They packaged the &quot;OLD_MERC.DRV&quot; file and fakecd to run it. 

I personally prefer the method I have explained above, due to the 

fact that this is in essence a &quot;worldwide crack&quot;, for any cd-rom 

based protection that will call that function to verify if

the drive is a cd-rom.                   



I hope that this has shed some light on cd-protection. 

I should have some more essays in the near future. 



Thanks and Take Care,

Indeed, Riddler, you are right! Teaching people interested in learning 

<U>and working on</U> this stuff 

HOW TO reverse engineer all protection of a given kind (all software 

for that matter, not only protections) seems to us (and I believe and hope 

that I'm speaking  

for the whole +HCU) much more interesting and constructive (and correct) 

than releasing ready made &quot;pre-cooked&quot; (easy) cracks for all lusers 

and leechers. People that would eventually have been able to help us, if 

we had only helped them a little to develop, will never learn anything thattaway!

Whatta waste!<BR> C'mon fellow crackers of all the groups of the alphabet... 

you know as well as I do how much fun our activity is... how rewarding and interesting 

it is to understand alien code... once you know how to proceed... once you 

have learned at least some of the hundred little tricks... C'mon! Share your 

knowledge with those that deserve it, instead of showing off for the greedy 

eyes of the &quot;me-too&quot; lusers!

Teach people how to start, some need only a little 

help to get rolling, and they will send us back TREASURES of knowledge 

once they have learned the basic stuff (and the advanced techniques as well :-)<BR>

We should never forget the words that +ORC printed in each lesson of his 

tut:</I><PRE ALIGN="CENTER"><CENTER>&quot;Give a man a crack, and he'll be hungry again tomorrow,

<BR>teach him how to crack, and he'll never be hungry again&quot;</CENTER></PRE>
