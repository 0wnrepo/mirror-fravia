<I>Well,  here is a new essay from our Srilankan friend, The Undertaker, who &quot;tackles&quot; 

here a 

commercial protector... and, as usual, said protectors make a very meagre figure! You'll 

learn something about Keyboard &amp; timer interrupt masking routines and the usual 

anti-softice trick (MOV SI,4647) here.<BR>A small critic: can you please please remember 

to GIVE THE EXACT LOCATION where we can download your targets? Yes, we all 

know how to search and find them... but what's the point of keeping to oneself a basic 

information like the BEST (quickest, &quot;bandwidthest&quot;) location for downloading our targets?</I><HR size="6">

JEREMY LILLEY'S PROTEXE! EXE/COM V5.5<BR>

Exploring a weak protection scheme<BR>

By<BR>

The Undertaker -=BANDA=-</CENTER></FONT><PRE>



<INTRODUCTION</b>

Well, I thought  that Jeremy was a good software protectionist.

My thoughts  shattered once I saw his protexe! program. 

Actually I expected lots of traps, of anti debugging tricks, of new methods 

of protection from a program named &quot;protexe&quot;! 

But I ended up with a big sad disappointment. 

Here is the story called &quot;Promising a lot and Delivering scant&quot;.

I think every reverser will feel like I do about protexe!.



<B>How I did proceed:</B>

First I encrypted a .EXE file using protexe!. 

I called it <FONT color="blue">test.exe</FONT>

Then I used Soft-Ice 2.80 to analyse the encrypted program. 

Let's go, +friends:

Load the encrypted program using Softice's loader.

<FONT color="blue">

ldr test.exe

</FONT>

In the early part of the encrypted file you can see 

Keyboard &amp; timer interrupt masking routines like.



XXXX:XXXX OUT   21,BA           --&gt;     Keyboard mask.

XXXX:XXXX OUT   21,BB           --&gt;     Keyboard &amp; timer mask.



Lame tricks isn't it? 

Avoid all these (don't trace into them) &amp; put a break point &amp; go.



BPINT   3



You'll land here...



XXXX:0194 CC            INT     3

XXXX:0195 EBFD          JMP     0194

XXXX:0197 AC            LOADSB

XXXX:0198 00F8          ADD     AL,BH

XXXX:019A 4A            DEC     DX

XXXX:019B 7503          JNZ     1A0

XXXX:019D 83E909        SUB     CX,+9         --&gt; ***

XXXX:01A0 76E3          MUL     BL



Now put a execution break point on 19D &amp; go.



BPX   19D



Then trace through the code until you see this..



XXXX:01F7 E421       IN      AL,21

XXXX:     3403       XOR     AL,03   --&gt; Enabling the previously

XXXX:     E621       OUT     21,AL   --&gt; masked keyboard &amp; timer int.



Rest of the code seems to be CRC checking routine. 

Skip all these junk until you find following snippet:



XXXX:024B E90000        JMP     24E

XXXX:024E E90000        JMP     251

XXXX:0251 8B868802      MOV     BX,[BP+288]



Mmmmm! two near jumps with no effects. 

Suspicious isn't it? 

But these two jumps will take you somewhere else once your .EXE file 

has been compressed before using the protexe!. 

If the file is compressed, these jumps take to the decompression 

routines of the packer. 

But if you didn't use any compression utility, before using the

protexe!, the above jumps have no effect. 

Ok! It does not matetr anyway if those jumps have any effect on your 

own test file or not, just skip the rest of the code (don't trace into 

nor process it) and scroll your code window  until you see following 

instructions.



XXXX:0352 E2F3          LOOP    347

XXXX:0354 BE4746        MOV     SI,4647       --&gt; **

XXXX:0357 B81109        MOV     AX,911

XXXX:035A CC            INT     3



Remember the Anti-Debugging tricks used to kick Soft-Ice. 

If you don't know or remember them, then read the <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#96'" tppabs="http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#96">relevant articles</A> 

provided on Fravia's. 

The above code looks to me as a very simple lame Anti-Debugging trick to kick 

Soft-Ice. 

Let's quickly crack this before we proceed.



Before you execute INT 3 set SI=0. 

Otherwise SoftIce get stoned. 

Then execute the INT 3 and process until you see the far jump. 

This jump take you to the original code of the .EXE file.



XXXX:XXXX    JMP  XXXX:XXXX   --&gt; This jump takes you to the

                                  beginning of the unprotected code.





Do you think such a <FONT color="blue">protexe!</FONT> can protect your  programs? 

D'you think you can get at least a 20% improvement in terms of protection?

I think that our Jeremy should re-think twice the coding of his protection 

scheme. 

Anyway no protector can protect 100% (should you believe you have found one, 

take a little rest and then crack it :-) 

But at least a commercial  protector should be able to do its job by some 

extent. So I was deceived.

But I found a good thing in protexe! Let's give Jeremy some merit: its good 

CRC checking scheme, and its integration, both are good and well written. 

Unfortunately this can be bypassed very easily as well, as you have seen :-)

By the way, let's not have an &quot;eurocentric&quot; vision of the world: most of the 

countries don't have any &quot;software laws&quot; at all! Including my country: Sri 

Lanka. 

Because of this, every protectionist's job is and will remain very open and 

clear!!! 

So there is no point in annoying the few that try to study seriously all these 

banal and uselessly stupid protection schemes in Europe or in the States... 

should it be necessary, we'll move the whole cracking scene inside a server in

SriLanka or elsewhere... and get much more nastier :-)





Greetings goes to all HCU+ friends....
