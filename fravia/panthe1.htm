Bravo.

     I have my two cents to toss into the forum of site changes.  Change

is good, though only when the result compliments the intent of the

venture.  

     I managed to find your site while attempting to learn to crack all

the latest proggies for the glory of having my handle posted on all

manner of warez sites when they were the "only sites worth visiting" in

my then deluded opinion; I ended up with alot more than I intended.  

     I'm concerned that if you limit essays to "Extremely advanced" this

site will become an "elite" site leaving anyone new to software -- I

might add that these are the people who need the knowledge most, before

they begin to blindly accept the MS-Methodology of programming -- "alone

in the deep dark codewoods."  It always seemed to me that this was an

open forum for anyone to learn.  Quite frankly, I've taken a look at

other "cracking" pages out there, and newbies can't help but be led into

the blind cracking they preach.  This site is a beacon of hope; a last

stand against the twilight of knowledge.  Draw them in with the

temptation of the crack, Plant the seeds of wisdom in secrecy, Help them

reap the benifits of knowledge.  Mankind by nature is drawn to creative

passifism -- Force Wisdom, Preach Philo Sophia.  Do not go quietly into

that good night!  Host knowledge in all of it's levels -- rage!. Rage

against the dying of the light!

     The essays are the rosetta stone; though mottled and frequently

misguided, they provide the key.  From them a more complete

"translation" should be born.  Remove the emphasis from the essays, and

direct it to a refined "Base Knowledge" encompassing OS architecture

(not restricted to PC) and hardware functionality (atleast for the

software aspects of the site).  Armed with such an arsenal anyone can

crack, reverse, engineer, research, protect, whatever their fancy, at

atleast a base level.  The pyramids were not built from the point

downward.

     Tools are the key to learning.  Newton needed an apple, Galileo

needed a telescope; <FONT color=blue>More emphasis should be placed on "Learning Tools",

as they are the reverser's crystal ball.  Documentation should accompany

each tool detailing the method in which it was implemented, thus the

tool itself becomes a lesson</FONT>.  A list of software projects should be

kept for interested parties to find one another and collaborate. 

Plutonium does little in small amounts...accumulate enough together and

the results are dramatic (as the people of Tchernobyl discovered

at all too high of a cost).

     Waste not efforts on directing the use of knowledge, to nature all

order must fall.  Some will damage programmers, some will damage

themselves, some will gain new knowledge, and in the end there is no

option but to share knowledge.  The struggle of Sysaphus accomplishes

more each day; A moment wasted is a tragedy to mankind and the lease we

have on life.

     Your site is truely an oasis in the vast Wasteland we have chosen

as our consortium.

     Thankyou for providing and maintaining such a valuable resource,

and holding the torch against the commercialization of our most valued 

possession -- Knowledge.
