<I>Well, this is another example of the funny 'time warping' effects on our deep 

deep web. I published Curious George's essay in <U>february 1997</U> and the first 

globale answer, this one by &lt;predator>, comes in september 1998, more than one and 

a half years later... whattd'you say? The web seems to be in another time continuum alltogether, doesn't 

it?<P> I'll leave you now with &lt;predator>'s observations, 

read (if I may suggest, at least two times, you'll thank me for this tip) and enjoy (and add if needs be). Of course be aware of the fact that this 

kind of reality cracking is the most "philosophical" one, as opposed to the more 'concrete' 

anti-advertisement essays, and you may well be one of those skeptical souls 

that feel the irresistible impulse to check if their wallet is still there 

everytime they hear somebody 

speaking about "soul" or "meme"</I> :-)<BR><I>Just kidding... there is a considerable 

depth inside &lt;predator>'s rantings (as well as inside Curious George's original ones) and 

when I read this kind of stuff I get the strange feeling that we humble crackers and code 

reversers (or 

"reversalists" as &lt;predator> calls us) are on the eve of unprevedible 

philosophical discoveries... could it be that in this world software and life are 

already so indissolubly bound that investigating the first you may find some of the answers for 

the oldest questions of our human race?</I><P>You may want to read first the

Dear Fravia:



...More than that, "Reality Cracking" can be accomplished 

by anyone with a critical mind.  You don't need hours 

of undisturbed time in front of the computer. You can 

practice your reality cracking skills all day long, 

everyday of your life! And you should, lest you be taken 

advantage of unknowingly...

...Having read all of the Reality Cracking section, and 

a decent amount of the rest, and being fascinated by the 

+ORC enigma, I felt compelled to write an essay that

covers two topics.  First, I discuss reality as a

whole.  Second, I tried to get into +ORC's mind (funny, 

me of all people, probably one who knows least about

him...) and find an overall motive... hope you enjoy!



Best Regards

Curious George<HR size=6>

An Essay Attempting to Justify the Relationship

Between Code Cracking and Reality Cracking</FONT>



written by Curious George

</CENTER></PRE>



(Introduction)<BR>

Our view of the world is our own. The particular set of

events that we experience over our lifetimes shapes what 

we see in the world. There are commonalities however.<BR>

They are large reality models that whole nations

subscribe to. There are different models. Some conflict 

with each other. All are subsets of the true Reality. 

We must crack reality.<BR>



<FONT color=blue>

*They are not necessarily subsets of true reality. Some of these<BR>

*reality models are complete raving delusions.</FONT>

<P>

(body)<BR>

øWhat is Reality Anyway?<BR>

<FONT color=blue>

*The universe is data, and interactions between data.<BR>

*Treat it as data and all will become clear. 

</FONT>

<P>

Lets start from the very beginning.  We talk of Reality

Cracking, but we don't really know what reality is, do we?

<FONT color=blue><PRE>*We can never actually know. "We" - our live code, the dynamic data structure 

*that we are, our "personality" - exists by proxy, molecularly encoded in a 

*biochemically based, massively parallel neural-net processor. Some call this

*a soul or spirit, or persona. The suite of simultaneously-operating 

*thought-process daemons in THIS head, which refers to itself as &lt;predator>'s 

*head refers to them as... well, just what they said they were at the start of 

*this paragraph : simultaneously-operating thought-process daemons. They/we/I 

*are a huge, parallel, evolving computation. A self-contained information

*ecology. So, I think, are you too.</PRE></FONT>

<P>

I believe (with lots of other people too, like Plato,

and Orwell to name two) that it is whatever you think it is.

<FONT color=blue><PRE>*Also correct. It cannot be otherwise in a symbol processor like the  brain,

*which emulates and models a perception-derived reality, but cannot experience

*it directly. A processor does not *know* its registers have any particular

*external pertinence, nor does a neuron *know* that its particular state of

*synaptic receptor density, neurotransmitter receptivity profile or axon 

*depolarisation have any pertinence or even relationship to anything. The 

*relationship is there, but the interacting components in this do not know

*it, even if they represent it. Only in recursion and self-reference do

*systems ever model themselves and thereby "know" themselves, insofar as a

*system can know anything. Read Douglas Hofstadter, "G–del Escher Bach".</PRE></FONT><P> 

More specifically, there are the models ("Paradigms") that

define reality for those who subscribe to them. 

<FONT color=blue><PRE>

*Correct, although explained from the human's-eye view, from the perspective

*of the processor. You want to get at the _code_, don't you? Here's the deal:

*first learn to understand that the universe and all the processes in it are

*understandable in terms of information systems. Start with the processor:

*the human neural network, codified in 3x10^9 base pairs in the human DNA 

*genome, implemented as billions of neurons connected combinatorially in 

*trillions of different ways. It has been honed by evolution to act as a kind 

*of universal computer - a Turing machine: it can emulate any process, be it 

*language, tool use, or abstract information processing. By biasing receptor 

*concentration, synaptic neurotransmitter synthesis rates, and indeed even 

*growing new transmission links in particular ways, the neural net trains 

*itself to do particular tasks, such as pattern recognition, information 

*storage, symbol processing, and a lot of other things. It has also evolved 

*in such a way as to be connected to inputs of incredible sensitivity and 

*large bandwidth; eyes, ears, skin, smell, taste, balance... these detect 

*external "real" events... photon capturings, (you perform breakdown thereof 

*and analysis of patterns therein, you have retinal neural-net preprocessing); 

*audio frequency spectrum analysis, temperature, pressure, acidity, the

*presence of certain molecules dissolved in gas or liquids, etc. The 

*detectors, usually G-proteins coupled to molecular signal-gain systems

*(usually catalytic cascades) turn it into "data" by various means, ultimately 

*represented by neural firings. These recieved patterns gradually are modelled 

*by the human neural net processor. The processor is also connected to

*actuators: muscles, which enable externally-detectable realities to be

*modified, and data to be transmitted.

*In humans, output bandwidth is slow and small, except for the output which 

*benefits the genes which code for us - the penis has _big_ output bandwidth.



*Speech is hopelessly slow, making love is hopelessly slow, dancing, writing,

*drawing, sign language, semaphore, typing... compared to the size of the 

*data structure that is the human personality, the output bandwidth for the 

*expression of human thought is trivial and totally inadequate to achieve 

*significant personality transfer without a lot of time to do it.



*Self-awareness comes when the net learns that it can observe the consequences

*of actions it decided to perform. It hears its own voice, or it sees its own 

*hand shake in front of own eyes. It comes eventually to recognise that in 

*the mirror, as it looks into its own eyes and points these detectors at 

*themselves, that there is a time when it is not "looking at other stuff" -

*it has discovered its own chassis. In English, this is explained by 

*a phrase like "Yep, I'm looking at me."



*footnote about penile bandwidth from a rant I sent to a fellow geneweaver:



 >Maybe I've memed you. I think transmission is simply one component of a 

 >multicomponent replication system, but a highly critical one nevertheless.

 >Transmitting into the aural port of say, a mute quadriplegic or a person who 

 >speaks a language different to that in which the transmission is codified, or 

 >into the ear of Dolly the sheep, are illuminating examples of contingencies 

 >which have to be met for replication, let alone successful transmission.

 >For memes, transmission is central to reproduction, because, like viri, they

 >need to find a new host into which to propagate. They are obliged to find

 >a processor to do their processing for them, since they can't do it 

 >themselves. Wanking also induces a kind of data transmission and it must be 

 >pointed out that the sheer amount of code that a functional orgasm transmits 

 >is quite vast. 1.5x10^9 base pairs per haploid spermatozoon, and  hmmm... 

 >several hundred million of them per ml of ... transmission fluid (grin). I 

 >think that by comparison a T3 fibre optic cable, at 4.5x10^7 bits per second, 

 >is left floundering in the dust, dwarfed by the sheer bandwidth of a 

 >mammalian penis, which also has channel division multiplexing (you can send 

 >several thousand million of the little data packets up the conduit at the 

 >same instant) plus there is huge redundancy too. Gives the term upload a 

 >whole new meaning. I think if my modem could transmit data that fast it'd 

 >groan and sigh too. :-)



*So much for the processor of interest. There are other processors using 

*other languages (cells process information in a molecular form, they have

*mechanisms functionally analogous to the electrical systems which humans 

*have built, but that's another rant entirely.) 



*You reversalists, the tiny, approaching-zero minority of brains harbouring

*thought processes like those that I harbour.... I promised you the _code_, 

*didn't I? Ok, cop this.



*Data is stuff which is changed, by changers which modify stuff. This is an

*obvious tautology. When the changers change the changers you have a chaotic

*highly nonlinear system, such as we are.



*Life is a set of processes which dynamically organise data.

*There is dead code... this is called data. Atoms are data. Charge states, 

*photon flux intensities, velocities, positions, size of first girlfriend's 

*shoe, etc etc etc... these are data. There they sit, statically related

*to each other, but they don't change much. You can represent these data with

*other data, like ASCII zeros and ones can represent the letter "p", or  a 

*bucket with eleven rocks in it can represent the number of protons in an 

*atom of sodium. Data representation is substrate independant, but some

*forms of data substrate lend themselves more easily to manipulated than 

*others. 



*There are functional codes... in mathematics, these are called (surprise)

*functions or relations; in physics you might call them operators (like

*Hamiltonians)... stuff data in, and it comes out changed in some way 

*dependant on the data and the function and the way the two interact.

*In a system like a cell it might be something like an active enzyme 

*modifying a "dead" molecule, maybe changing its stereochemistry or

*ripping off an atom... in programming it might be a function like 

*incrementing the x register or comparing what's in the x register with the

*y register. Functional code modifies dead code. Functional code alters the

*links between distinct chunks of dead code. Functional code is special: it

*can use dead code to represent other dead code. This is data emulation, or

*more commonly, symbolism. Computation is what functional code does to data. 

*Functional code, very importantly, can turn dead code into more functional

*code. Functional code can turn functional code into dead code, too. 

*There are many kinds of functional code, and the chances are good that by

*sheer accident, functional code will arise out of dead code. This never 

*happens in digital computing since what the processor gets to chew on is all 

*deliberately predetermined. Nonetheless, I think it'd be interesting to

*say, stuff random values into, say, a MESS-DOG program segment pointer and

*see what happens... (this is the computational equivalent of the Miller-Urey

*biology experiments which I'd encourage you to look up). I think you might 

*occasionally get a few instructions which accidentally did something useful, 

*and even less frequently, ones which replicated themselves. But it would be 

*very rare. Give it enough time and clock cycles, it'll nonetheless happen.

*Its all computation and data. "Artificial Life" (Steven Levy) is an 

*illuminating tome in this regard, since computation is also substrate

*independant. Conway's Game of Life is similarly illuminating.



*The really interesting stuff happens when these two code systems 

*start to interact... you get firstly referential code, like "That cat is

*obese"; then self-referential code, which can represent logical absurdities, 

*like "This is not a sentence" or self-definitional truth "This sentence

*has five words"; then self-reproducing code "Copy this sentence", and

*ultimately self-modifying code "Copy this sentence backwards twice". 

*"Life" has all of these, and combinations thereof, built out of interactions 

*between dead code and live code. Their interactions are the origin of

*evolution. Excellent examples are there in Hofstadter: "Metamagical Themas", 

*particularly in Chapter 3, which pertains to memes and viral sentences.



*The replicating data system (human being) is coded in DNA which expresses

*enzymes, which do the functional code stuff. Each enzyme is encoded in DNA

*as what is called a "gene". Genes encode enzymes, cells, organs, organisms,

*ecosystems, to get themselves replicated down the generations. Genes do not

*know this any more than a bacteria knows it has genes. Most humans think

*they're something special, they're wrong: they're just accidentally evolved 

*replicators, with brains which occasionally realise what they are. By analogy,

*to genes, Richard Dawkins came up with the idea of the "meme" - a replicating 

*thought process data structure. (See "The Selfish Gene, 2nd Ed, Chapter 10") 

*Simple memes embody catchy tunes, more complex ones are codified in axioms, 

*phonemes, life-protocols, taboos, oral traditions, blah blah etc along with 

*hundreds of other replicators, ranging from totally accurate and logical to 

*utterly fucking insane, end up forming mutually-self-supporting colonies 

*called ideologies, belief-systems, paradigms, weltanschauungs, religions... 

*call 'em what you will, I call them meme complexes. Here are some components 

*of JARG400.ZIP plus replicator-relevant chunks added in support my stance:



                 ))))))))



     Criterion for a lifeform: (von Neumann) - the essence of life is a _process_.



     :replicator: n. Any construct that acts to produce copies of itself;

                 this could be a living organism, an idea (see {meme}), a program (see

                 {quine}, {worm}, {wabbit}, {fork bomb}, and {virus}), a pattern in a 

		 cellular automaton (see {life}, sense 1), or (speculatively) a robot or

                 {nanobot}. 



                 It is even claimed by some that {{UNIX}} and {C} are the symbiotic

                 halves of an extremely successful replicator; see {UNIX conspiracy}.





     :memetics: /me-met'iks/ [from {meme}] The study of memes. As of

                 mid-1993, this  is still an extremely informal and speculative endeavor, 

		 though the first steps towards at least statistical rigor have been made 

		 by H. Keith Henson and others. Memetics is a popular topic for speculation 

		 among hackers, who like to see themselves as the architects of the new 

	 	 information ecologies in which memes live and replicate.







      :meme: /meem/ [coined by analogy with `gene', by Richard Dawkins] n. An

                 idea considered as a {replicator}, esp. with the connotation that memes 

		 parasitize people into propagating them much as viruses do. Used esp.

                 in the phrase `meme complex' denoting a group of mutually supporting

                 memes that form an organized belief system, such as a religion. This 

		 lexicon is an (epidemiological) vector of the `hacker subculture' meme 

		 complex; each entry might be considered a meme. However, `meme' is often 

		 misused to mean `meme complex'. Use of the term connotes acceptance of 

		 the idea that in humans (and presumably other tool- and language-using 

		 sophonts) cultural evolution by selection of adaptive ideas has 

		 superseded biological evolution by selection of hereditary traits. 

		 Hackers find this idea congenial for tolerably obvious reasons.







      :meme plague: n. The spread of a successful but pernicious {meme}, esp.

                 one that parasitizes the victims into giving their all to propagate it. 

		 Astrology, BASIC, and the other guy's religion are often considered

                 to be examples. This usage is given point by the historical fact that

                 `joiner' ideologies like Naziism or various forms of millennarian 

		 Christianity have exhibited plague-like cycles of exponential growth 

		 followed by collapses to small reservoir populations.







       :nanotechnology:: /nan'-oh-tek-no`l*-jee/ n. A hypothetical fabrication

		 technology in which objects are designed and built with the

                 individual specification and placement of each separate atom. The first

                 unequivocal nanofabrication experiments took place in 1990, for 

		 example with the deposition of individual xenon atoms on a nickel 

		 substrate to spell the logo of a certain very large computer company. 

		 Nanotechnology has been a hot topic in the hacker subculture ever since 

		 the term was coined by K. Eric Drexler in his book "Engines of Creation", 

		 where he predicted that nanotechnology could give rise to replicating 

 		 assemblers, permitting an exponential growth of productivity and personal 

		 wealth. See also {blue goo}, {gray goo}, {nanobot}.







       :wabbit: /wab'it/ [almost certainly from Elmer Fudd's immortal line

                 "You wascawwy wabbit!"] n. 1. A legendary early hack reported on a

                 System/360 at RPI and elsewhere around 1978; this may have descended 

		 (if only by inspiration) from hack called RABBITS reported from 1969 on a

                 Burroughs 55000 at the University of Washington Computer Center. 

		 The program would make two copies of itself every time it was run, 

		 eventually crashing the system. 2. By extension, any hack that includes 

		 infinite self-replication but is not a {virus} or {worm}. See {fork bomb} 

		 and {rabbit job}, see also {cookie monster}.







      :sig virus: n. A parasitic {meme} embedded in a {sig block}.

		 There was a {meme plague} or fad for these on USENET in late 1991.

                 Most were equivalents of "I am a .sig virus. Please reproduce me in your 

		 .sig block.". Of course, the .sig virus's memetic hook is the giggle 

		 value of going along with the gag; this, however, was a self-limiting 

		 phenomenon as more and more people picked up on the idea. There were 

		 creative variants on it; some people stuck `sig virus antibody' texts 

		 in their sigs, and there was at least one instance of a sig virus eater.



*I have an interesting bilingual version of this virus. The bilinguality

*of the package is probably self-advantageous to the .sig virus when it is in

*Germany or Englishspeaking nations:

*Ich bin ein .signature Virus. Mach' mit und kopiere mich in Deine .signature.

*Don't ask what it means, just put it in your .signature, okay?



                  



     :fork bomb: [UNIX] n. A particular species of {wabbit} that can be

                 written in one line of C (`main() {for(;;)fork();}') or shell 

		 (`$0 & $0 &') on any UNIX system, or occasionally created by an 

		 egregious coding bug. A fork bomb  process `explodes' by recursively 

		 spawning copies of itself (using the UNIX 

		 system call `fork(2)'). Eventually it eats all the process table

                 entries and effectively wedges the system. Fortunately, fork bombs 

		 are relatively easy to spot and kill, so creating one deliberately 

		 seldom accomplishes more than to bring the just wrath of the gods 

	 	 down upon the perpetrator. See also  {logic bomb}.







     :phage: n. A program that modifies other programs or databases in

		 unauthorized ways; esp. one that propagates a {virus} or {Trojan

                 horse}.See also {worm}, {mockingbird}. The analogy, of course, 

		 is with phage viruses in biology.







      :virus: [from the obvious analogy with biological viruses, via SF]

		 n. A cracker program that searches out other programs and `infects'

                 them by embedding a copy of itself in them, so that they become {Trojan

                 horse}s. 

		 When these programs are executed, the embedded virus is executed too, thus 

		 propagating the `infection'. This normally happens invisibly to the

                 user. 

		 Unlike a {worm}, a virus cannot infect other computers without

                 assistance. 

		 It is propagated by vectors such as humans trading programs with

                 their friends (see {SEX}). The virus may do nothing but propagate itself

                 and then allow the program to run normally. Usually, however, after

                 propagating silently for a while, it starts doing things like writing cute

                 messages on the terminal or playing strange tricks with the display 

		 (some viruses include nice {display hack}s). Many nasty viruses, written by

                 particularly perversely minded {cracker}s, do irreversible damage, 

		 like nuking all the user's files.

		 In the 1990s, viruses have become a serious problem, especially among

                 IBM PC and Macintosh users (the lack of security on these machines enables

                 viruses to spread easily, even infecting the operating system). The

                 production of special anti-virus software has become an industry, 

		 and a number of exaggerated media reports have caused outbreaks of 

		 near hysteria among users; many {luser}s tend to blame *everything* 

		 that doesn't work as they had expected on virus attacks. Accordingly, 

		 this sense of `virus' has passed not only into techspeak but into 

		 also popular usage (where it is often incorrectly used to denote a 

		 {worm} or even a {Trojan horse}). See {phage}; compare {back door}; 

		 see also {UNIX conspiracy}.



	:worm: [from `tapeworm' in John Brunner's novel "The Shockwave Rider",

                 via XEROX PARC] n. A program that propagates itself over a network,

                 reproducing itself as it goes. Compare {virus}. Nowadays the term 

		 has negative connotations, as it is assumed that only {cracker}s 

		 write worms. Perhaps the best-known example was Robert T. Morris's 

		 `Internet Worm' of 1988, a `benign' one that got out of control and 

		 hogged hundreds of Suns and VAXen across the U.S. See also {cracker}, 

		 {RTM}, {Trojan horse}, {ice}.





	:quine: /kwi:n/ [from the name of the logician Willard V. Quine, via

                 Douglas Hofstadter] n. A program that generates a copy of its own 

		 source text as its complete output. Devising the shortest possible 

		 quine in some given programming language is a common hackish amusement. 

		 Here is one classic quine:



                    ((lambda (x)

                     (list x (list (quote quote) x)))

                    (quote

                      (lambda (x)

                       (list x (list (quote quote) x)))))



                 This one works in LISP or Scheme. It's relatively easy to write

                 quines in other languages such as Postscript which readily handle 

		 programs as data; much harder (and thus more challenging!) in languages 

		 like C which do not. Here is a classic C quine for ASCII machines:



                   char*f="char*f=%c%s%c;main()

                    {printf(f,34,f,34,10);}%c";

                    main(){printf(f,34,f,34,10);}



                 For excruciatingly exact quinishness, remove the interior line

                 breaks. Some infamous {Obfuscated C Contest} entries have been quines that

                 reproduced in exotic ways.

                 Question: Why do otherwise normal people go totally fucking crazy? 



                 First a few definitions: 



                 Meme: an idea considered as a replicator. See Ch 11 Dawkins, The Selfish Gene.



                 Culture: A growth of a single type of replicator upon a fuel/substrate.





                      Eg: -a group of bacteria on a growth medium



                        -industrial society on petroleum-derived energy + mineral wealth



                        -memes on language-using sophont data storage media (brains)



                 These can be broadly considered as evolved, geographically-confined group 

	 	 social parameters. Hence you have things called "Work Ethics" and

                 "Corporate Culture" and so on.

                             Avoidance of alleged eternal torture for adherents. 

                             Supposed post-mortal reward for particular "good" behaviour

                 Corporation: Literally "Embodiment". 

                        Organised, hierachial behaviour controlling belief system.

                 ##Woohoo! LAWS!



                 Well, we all know the things which run the world. Corporations, governments,

                 religions and cultures, in approximately that order. They are all immortal,

                 information-based life forms growing in the interconnected hardware/software

                 substrate of language-compatible human brains. Yet they all depend on a

                 commonality of persona in the substrates in which they reside. If you like, 

                 an operating system. This "OS" is the collection of "strings" attached to

                 a persona during childhood, which get pulled later on, to bring about desired 

                 behavioural effects (obedience, submission, etc) in people. These strings are 

                 woven into the fabric of a child's psyche at an early age, before the child 

                 realises what is being done.



                 The child, a Turing system (capable of emulating any process given enough 

                 time) develops autonomy in approximately the following order. 



                 1) Child learns operation of basic body functions. Eyes, larynx, arms, legs,

                   head (etc). This takes about a year or two.

               

                 2) Once the neural net has learnt how to deal with stimulus (input) and

                   invoke useful output (response) on more than a reflex level, environmental 

                   manipulation can commence, since the discovery is eventually made that 

                   particular manners of direct physical interaction evoke changes to the 

                   personal world. Aversion to certain things is associated here, such as 

                   fire, cold, and physical damage stimuli. This also takes only a couple 

                   of years.



                 3) Syntactic structures are deduced and gradually an abstract-capable meme 

                   and data transfer medium, language, is learnt. This process drops out of

                   the child in the late teens, hence the difficulty of learning new 

                   languages from the late teens onwards.



                 4) It starts to learn to transmit information by vocal or other gestures, and 

                   learns that such information transmission can modify the surrounding

                   environment in order to meet particular local needs, in a directed way, 

                   eg: being fed, kept warm, touched and held, etc. This process continues

                   for the life of the individual though at a much reduced rate after the

                   mid-teens.



                 5) The kid now has crude, nonphysical remote interaction with objects other 

                   than oneself. Soon comes mobility, directed experimental manual 

                   manipulation of objects, then purposeful, goal-oriented complex action. 

                   This includes building of a world-model : the deduction that magic does 

                   not work, certain thought processes are self-contradictory, that there

                   is a relationship between certain actions and behaviours, and between                   

		   particular causes and effects. The world-model is subject to continual

                   lifelong environmental modification, though with training induced 

                   early enough, it can be stopped in its tracks.



                 (is it possibly entirely arbitrary that we have states "childhood" and

                 "adulthood" Or is it like "L" plates for a few years, then a full

                 license?)



                 ##YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! 



                 Here, the memes install themselves, at the behest of their current carriers - 

                 parents and educators - before the child has a chance to analyse them for 

                 raving inconsistency. The severity of the installation is often shocking.



                 Kids are beaten senseless in some cases, merely because they're crying

                 about something they fail to understand. But it works.



                 M-S.D.O.S. Meme-System Destruction Of Singularity



                 This is my (: name for the meme-set initially installed in small children.

                 It is the behavioural profile upon which rests the huge subsequent edifice of

                 ideological replicators. 



                 Theory = When you possess an idea.

                 Ideology = When an idea possesses you.



                 So:

                 Answer) You can pull core coding, the "Kernel", out of pre-1970s child raising

                 and parenthood manuals. They are designed primarily to make life easier for

                 the parents at the cost of inhibiting the growth of the child. The hidden 

                 irrational memetic tenets to be adhered to, are these:



                 1) Adults are the masters of the (dependant!) child. They're not its servants.

                 2) Adults are infallible. Their edicts are quite literally rules-by-decree.

                 3) Adults get angry due to some fault in the child (not the adult's fault!). 

                 4) Adults cannot bear their own weakness and thus must not be told of it.

                 5) Adult autocracy is threatened by child vitality.

                 6) Adults MUST break the _child's will_ as soon as possible at all costs.

                 7) Adults must implement these tenets before the child realises they're fake.



                 What are the memes which actually enable these tenets to be fulfilled?

                 An incomplete list, which gives a flavour of the components, is below:



                 <NOTE: a meme can be totally false, but will propagate if it has some

                  survival value to the carrier>



                 ##Like - you won't get bashed if you obey me! I can _DEFINITELY_ use this - 

                 ##incorporate it into my theory, etc. etc.



                 1) A feeling of duty produces love.       

                 2) Hatred can be discarded by forbidding it.   

                 3) Parents automatically deserve respect just because they are parents.

                   <CF. 4th commandment>             

                 4) Children are unworthy of respect since they are merely children. 

                 5) Obedience makes one strong.          

                 6) High self-esteem is harmful.          

                 7) Low self-esteem is conducive to altruism.   

                 8) Tenderness or emotionality is bad.       

                 9) Responding to child needs is wrong.      

                 10) Severity and coldness to children better prepares them for life. 

                 11) Pretentious gratitude is better than honest ingratitude.   

                 12) The way you BEHAVE is more important than the way you really are. 

                 13) Parents nor God can survive being offended.        

                 14) The human body, its functions and appendages are dirty and disgusting. 

                 15) Strong feelings are harmful and to be supressed.

                 16) Parents are free of guilt, or drives, or desires.

                 17) Parents, teachers and authority figures are always right. 

                 18) Questioning is a show of weakness.

                 19) Submission makes one acceptible to others.



                 It is probably that the few core elements listed here are the back-doors by 

                 which subsequently-exposed meme-systems make their way into the mindset

                 without the new host being entirely aware of it. Hence, things like 

                 religious lies (eternal life after death, etc), large-government lies 

                 (representative democracy gives you a say, etc) and similar world-model

                 incongruities can establish viable and propagating colonies of themselves 

                 in human thought-space.



                 So... how do parents and teachers install/instill these obviously ludicrous 

                 belief viruses into ignorant youngsters?



                 Basically, by creating an environment where adherence to such memes has a

                 positive survival value. It works like so:



                 You (parent) know that the child has certain central and important needs 

                 which it cannot tend to for itself and this gives you massive power over

                 the child. Therefore, if you need to get the child to do something it might

                 not want to do, you just give it a choice: 



                 do (unpleasant thing I want you to do)

                 or (I'll let you starve ~ stop talking to you ~ beat you up).



                 Since kids really hate being ostracised, starved, assaulted (etc), they

                 are likely to do what the alternative is, regardless of the repugnance.



                 Typical ploys used to instill the feeling of powerlessness in children

                 include -



                 -Lay traps which the kid can't help falling into, then blame it for doing so.

                 -Lie. Lie often. Admonish the kid for seeing the truth, it will prefer lies.

                 -Physically threaten, beat (etc) the child if its thoughts are not those 

                  required for proper control. 

                 -Isolate kid from social interaction, games, parental love (etc) if required.

                 -Scare the kid "You'll die if you play with yourself, fart, burp" etc.

                 -Ridicule of, disdain for, and being scornful to, kids for doing (whatever).

                 -Invoke "Satan" meme: "You are bad, unconditionally, and will burn in hell".



                 One associates reward with the lies and aversion with the truth.



                 Eventually, even when these idea codes have no artificial survival value

                 around for reinforcement (say, at age 18 once out of school) they will

                 be so deeply implanted in the kid, before it was even aware of it, that

                 they will remain.



                 ##Actually - I think that 'growing up' and 'rebelling' are probably kids 

                 ##realising that some of the memes they have are no longer useful...

                 ##There's not really any such thing as 'no longer useful', just 'no longer 

                 ##connected with my fear centres'. What probably happens is that certain 

                 ##connections between symbols get SO strong that they become _VERY_ difficult 

                 ##to break down.



                 ##Another not - look how destructive rebelling can be to some people 

                 ##(untempered drug use, drop-out, etc - also some REAL negative survival 

                 ##traits)



                 So... people fear going to a hell which doesn't exist. They obey laws which 

                 are demonstrably stupid. They do the underpaid bidding of some rude, bullying,

                 insensitive prick of an employer. They're too burnt and glazed to have a 

                 purpose in their lives other than that ascribed to them by the system they 

                 live in : have kids, do work, earn money. Consume, be silent, die.



                 ##A hell which may not exist. Yes - I like this stuff.



                 Which is exactly what society (comprised mostly of similarly reared persons) 

                 wants: programmable, unquestioning Turing computers. 



                 Eventually, if people brought up this way have to deal with an 

                 intense emotional decision, they become anxious and incapable of

                 decision.



                 And if not, they carry around the cognitive dissonance (as Chomsky calls it) 

                 of believing outright lies from childbirth yet seeing a totally different 

                 and undeniably observably truthful reality. 



                 Hence they either have to go through the massive efforts of changing

                 these centrally rooted beliefs, or they go neurotic, or insane, in the face 

                 of a reality they have been conditioned to be incapable of dealing with

                 rationally. 



                 The logic bombs explode. Roll on prozac, depression, mental illness and

                 suicide.



                 ##This is fucking incredible! Who is this guy? I want to talk to him ASAP.



                 Now you know.

#'s 2, 3, and 5 all are aspects of 1. I list these as

separate, because for some people

they are strong enough to become the principle model of

reality with the others simply

being general cultural factors. i.e. a MD has the

strongest affinity for 3, and 1 contains

2 and 5 for him. A reporter on the other hand has the

strongest affinity for 2, and 1

contains for him 3 and 5.<FONT color=blue><PRE>

*I too have found it hard to classify these in terms of each other, and I

An Appeal to Authority

I mentioned Plato and Orwell above. Let me support

*to have a shot back at it. Suck my 50-calibre, Plato, I've had a long time

*thinking about this one....</PRE></FONT><P>



Suppose there is a person who is

sitting inside a cave and watching

shadows dance on the wall of the cave. This is the only

thing that he can perceive. For that

person, because the shadows form the whole of his

perception, that is Reality. But because

his perception is false and limited, he fails to

realize that just above and behind him there

are other people dancing around a fire which casts

shadows onto the wall below that he is

looking at.<FONT color=blue><PRE>*It irritates the hell out of me that people just say "Plato said X" and 

*that this is automatically seen as an excuse to not think the situation thru.

*Humans are more than a set of eyes, and they can test their own perception.

*Gendankenexperiments are there for the doing. In the glimmer of the reflected 

*firelight, he'd see the shadow of his own thumb on himself, its shape slowly

*changing as he moved his thumb around relative to his chest upon which the

*dim shadow of his moving, illuminated thumb would appear. He might think 

*that the laws governing these shadows were similar, unless, of course, he

*is Plato and too stupid to think of these obvious reality perception tests.

*Yes, our perceptions have limits, and they are often false. This does not 

*require of us that all the deductions we make about them be necessarily

*false either. Especially if we get a clue about what to look for from other

*systems running the same physical laws. Modelling is not always a first

*derivative. 

*The cave sitter could certainly have sussed out something like the inverse

*square law by, say, looking at how much of his field of view his thumbnail

*took up depending on how far away from his eye it was. Try it now: close up

*thumb looks huge, far away thumb looks small. Thumb _feels_ same, so maybe it 

*didn't change size. Maybe my perception of my thumb is governed by some rule.

*Oh and look, the shadow my thumb casts is very similar to thumb size the 

*closer it is to the surface on which the shadow is cast. Shadow grows when

*thumb is closer to the light. Shadow moves when I flex my thumb. Hey, what's

*going on is there's some light source, and somewhere between it and the wall

*there's something moving. My thumb shadow looks pretty wonky when I throw it 

*on my toes, which are lumpy, but the shadow looks like my thumb when it 

*lands upon my flat chest.... does this tell me that the wall over there is 

*somehow wonky like my toes, and thus it messes around with shadows, so I

*know what's going on but I can't view it any better down here in the

*cave... the flickering light and the lumpy damn wall's messing it up.

*Sure, we do not see in ultraviolet, cannot detect earth's magnetic field.

*detachment from one's thoughts becomes possible. I think this has some

In 1984 Orwell explicitly mentioned the Paradigm

concept. In the novel, he constructed a

"giant conspiracy" in which the elite imposed their own

Paradigm on the world. People who

live outside the accepted Paradigms are in powerful

positions...and consequently they have

enemies...anyway, the story takes place a long time

since the conspiracy was implemented.

Basically the story is about the conspiracy's

self-regulation method kicking into effect.

There will always be humans who question, and in this

situation they were betrayed and crushed.

about the conspiracy right before he is

crushed. The hero learns that life wasn't always like

it is now, and that the whole situation

was constructed to keep the world in stasis. He learns

that occasionally people like him begin

to question Reality, but they are easily discovered by

the Betrayer and his ilk.

Anyway, the ideas I present here aren't mine. I've

On Cracking

<BR><BR>

Below I attempt to unearth an underlying motive for why

+ORC is so interested in Reality

Cracking. Why did he wait for so long before bringing

this topic up?  Why mention it at all

(as opposed to sticking with "pure" cracking)?

<BR><BR>

Shall I be vague and fictionalesque for a 

moment?<FONT color=blue><PRE>*virtual reality mode (on)</PRE></FONT><P> 

Enjoy:<BR><BR>



So, there's this website that I've found that's really

wonderful. There are some people who

think like me and they're also computer experts. They

"crack" things...but the cracking thing

isn't the truly special part. Cracking is an awesome

skill, and doing the exercises will

certainly help become a better Reality Cracker in

general, but I've never been one for doing

exercises...so why is this site so great?<BR>

<BR>

Well there's this "entity" who is a master. His amount

of skill demands that he hide himself

thoroughly.  He wants to share his knowledge with

others (lonely to be alone?) so he gets some

students. They are his most advanced and he only talks

to them occasionally and sporadically.<BR>

They don't know who he is. So anyway this entity writes

some tutorials for his students. They

learn and become really good. They create a whole

"virtual" (ack! Media word. :) academy where

they discuss and feed off each other. He is happy with

this but it is taking a life of its own. <FONT color=blue><PRE>*a phrase diagnostic that you have some awareness of the nature of information.

*It isnt taking a life of its own... it --IS-- a lifeform, using him for the

*purpose of exploration and the others in the group as a data source.</PRE></FONT><P> 

What he really wants to do is get people to think like

him. <FONT color=blue><PRE>*From the meme point of view: his memes wish to propagate but they need him

*to build a funnel to catch prospective adepts (this site), and sieve them

*for adeptitude (the strainers). Or perhaps just to trawl for those who

*already do think like him. We are rare in this world.</PRE></FONT><P>





How do I know this? Well he is writing/began to write

letters to his (principal?) students (who

published some of it) where he is talking about the

same stuff. The cracking thing was just a

way to get there. (a necessary way? I don't know.)

<BR><BR>

Why did the master choose cracking? Well computers/

Internet can be viewed as a metaphor for

Reality. Say that what exists on the internet (the set

of Omega) is the true reality. <FONT color=blue><PRE>*"Push technology" happened, accidentally, in biology. Chloroplasts poisoned

*many organisms to extinction, but provided a fuel for new organisms. That

*poison, that fuel - was oxygen. You are living on the waste products of 

*plants. The breakthrough technology was photosynthesis, which uses quantum

*tunnelling to achieve charge separation, getting energy from light. It was 

*beneficial to some organisms to be able to make energy from light,

*but the ecosystem didn't know this, nor did the bacteria who could do it.



*Where do the crackers fit into this? They're live data structures which seek 

*to understand and benefit other data structures. Most of you understand the 

*informational nature of your own being, I suspect, although by proxy, and in 

*the languages of Assembler, or C... not the language of molecular signal 

*processing or gene regulation or neural net systems of which you are 

*comprised.



*Moore's Law, like any law which says growth is infinite, will eventually 

*cease to hold true. Microsoft will eventually die, though this might take

*a long time... there are corporations out there, such as Rothschilds,

*which have lasted 500 years... there are other memesystems, like Islam,

*and Judaism, which have existed for a couple of millennia. There are 

*copies of sequences of DNA which have existed since the dawn of life...

*we find them in the oldest, simplest organisms. These codes did not protect

*their hosts from eventual obsolescence, but the code remains. 



*Had the soon-to-be-extinct anaerobes been able to comprehend this, they'd 

*have been disgusted too. But this was all a blind, accidental process.

*Computer technology evolution, regardless of how "purposeful" it appears, 

*is precisely the same. The best systems are not always the ones which

*survive... remember the Lisa from Apple? The 80n8sux segment:offset address 

*architecture is a spectacular example of fuckwitness, yet it prevails in the 

*marketplace. (There is a good book you should read, Accidental Empires by 

*Robert X Cringely.) Why? It does something useful for lots of people. It, 

*like biological life, need not be elegant, it need only work, and work better

*than things with which it competes on several criteria. Humanity has dead

*code in it... we get scurvey because our copy of the gene for making vitamin

*C is broken. We get folate deficiency for similar reasons. We age and die 

*because our cell-copying mechanisms are lossy, chunks of our chromosomes

*(which contain DNA coding for the enzymes which do important chemical

*functions) get lost with each cell copy/iteration. Only our gametes (sperm 

*and eggs), as well as particular immortal tumor cell types, possess 

*Telomerase, which stops this degradation. The data in our genes doesn't know 

*or care that the carriers it builds are programmed to rot, regardless of the 

*suffering that entails... and you thought Micro$oft was crippleware!</PRE></FONT><P>







Say that

what we see in the Western Paradigm is what is given to

us through Yahoo, CNN, Micro$oft, and

Pointcast (especially. The whole idea of push

technology is especially revolting). Say that

when one cracks one is performing the act of seeking

the Truth.<FONT color=blue><PRE>*yes... seeking one version of some truth...</PRE></FONT><P> 





For example, this web site teaches how to search the

web well, more specifically, it shows the

reader that there are other methods besides www search

engines to do it. It doesn't actually

TEACH you how to search. (that seems to be changing,

however.) Why? Because the author is

struggling with the question of how obvious he should

make his material. He seems to have

settled on the idea of a "brain activity pre-requisite"

but that level isn't defined and thus

it fluctuates depending on what you read.<FONT color=blue><PRE>   *I mentioned the seives...</PRE></FONT><P> 



Anyway, the results you get from each different way of

searching the web are like different

Paradigms. They all overlap somewhat and to find

interesting results you perform "set

operations" on the results. The only way this works is

to be outside any particular Paradigm so

that you know that the others that don't overlap with

yours exist at all.

<BR><BR>

Now lets look at cracking more specifically. There are

the creators of the program, there are

the crackers, there are the programs themselves, there

are the protection schemes, and there

are the cracks.

<BR><BR>

Going back to the Orwell example, the programmers are

the conspirators. Their program is the

Paradigm. Their protection method is the

self-regulation scheme (thought police). The crackers

are the heroes. The cracks are what Orwell didn't have;

the heroes were destroyed in his book.

In his world, the heroes started off at a lower level

than the crackers of the academy. The

heroes had to first recognize that there was a Paradigm

at all, then they had to crack it. But

in this situation Orwell created the "uncrackable

protection scheme" and the heroes were crushed

before they began the actual crack.

<BR><BR>

Now back to cracking as a metaphor. Every exercise that

is published, every essay written, and

every strainer is a metaphorical exercise for cracking

a Paradigm. You have to search through

the various programs until you find a new protection

method. Then you use the skills and intuition

that you've developed thus far to crack this new

method. The mentality required to solve these

types of problems is EASILY mapable onto the real

world.<FONT color=blue><PRE>*Yes</PRE></FONT><P> 

IMHO this is why the master chose cracking as the way.

(besides the fact that he is damn good at

it and it is especially appropriate for our

contemporary situation.)<FONT color=blue><PRE>*I am nevertheless curious what s/he/it seeks... 

*The zen you seek is not the True Zen. The True Zen is not the destination,

On Those Who Seek the Truth

<BR><BR>

There are people out there who've completely quit the

mainstream reality model and are living on

the outside. (+ORC being one of them). They actively

try to keep as open as possible, that way

hoping the be in a receptive enough state to get a

glimpse at the "Truth."<FONT color=blue><PRE>*Also I, though I keep my meme-filters up. In many ways, I'm caught in the 

*machine, strapped to the same biochemical rails as all the other humans out

*there. Eating shits me. Sleeping shits me. I wish I didn't have to maintain

*this carcass, house it, clothe it, and shut it down for a quarter of its

*operational time. The rareness of serious intelligence shits me. All my 

*neighbors are dopey... they are into V8 engines, or TV serials, or Sports

*Illustrated. NONE of them even possess the vocabulary to understand computing.

*One of them reckons you can eradicate a virus by turning the computer off...

*he also reckons that injecting powdered rocks from the moon will cure AIDS.</PRE></FONT><P> 



There are various established Ways to seek the truth

that one may use. Many of the religions

that have become Paradigms in themselves once were

effective ways.<FONT color=blue><PRE>*Religions often deliberately hide truth, and for many people that's not a

*bug, that's a feature. Religions evolved to solve implicitly nasty questions

*with uncontestable answers, some of which are really ridiculous. Why are

*we susceptilbe to this sort of stuff? Because truth hurts. Mortality, for 

*instance.</PRE></FONT><P> 



Some still can be, but when

the religion is part of the larger paradigm, it is

pretty hopeless.  Some methods include first

breaking from the Paradigm before seeking the truth

(like Zen monastaries), and others such as

cracking + reality cracking only concern themselves

with breaking away from that Paradigm.<FONT color=blue><PRE>*It's hacking the Self. It all exists in the head, matey, and it is there

*that we must self-trawl and patch the code which makes us up.</PRE></FONT><P>





Is it built into our natures to be limited so we can't

see it and only catch glimpses and shadows,

or can we actually get the truth? (There are people in

the past who've gotten as far as we can

get, say Buddha, Jesus, the Zen masters...you know, the

founders of the great religions).<FONT color=blue><PRE>*Not entirely correct. History has warped the story in these cases, which are

*often not explicit in their teachings (thereby increasing their audiences)</PRE></FONT><P>



The true question that (I think) the master is leading

them toward is to tackle the question,

"Is it possible for humans to know the Truth?"<FONT color=blue><PRE>*Yes. We _create_ it. We discover representations of it, but ultimately,

*it's an artefact in our heads.</PRE></FONT><P>





So, before beginning on this question, he must first

get his students to  remove the gauze

from their eyes that humanity puts on itself, so that 

they may see with the maximum ability

that humans can see with. It is like when a Zen student

goes to the monastery and the brothers

let him stay and mediate...that is us now, and when the

brothers grant him fellowship, that is

breaking from the paradigm...and when the brother

reaches Zen that is the ultimate goal...for

as we have seen before, all the philosophies and

religions that humans come up with are just

different approaches spawned from that culture/time

*A very perceptive and forward thinking proposition. I'll be most interested

*to see what the +sensei(s) have to say about my rant. Probably chuck it in 

*the good ol' /dev/null oblivion hole. Anyway, for the record: I'm merely a

*molecular geneticist, but I want to reverse my *own* DNA one day. Nature also 

*has her protection systems, and she worked them out long before we appeared. 



*She does tricks with data which turn my eyeballs funny. She uses compression,

*she uses intercalation-of-code-with-junk to prevent theft, and selective 

*removal of junk code to yield functional code. I can't begin to tell you how 

*amazing biochemistry is, but you probably have an inkling of it from hacking,

*I think. I was once 65C02 ASM weenie. Noone writes anything for the old 6502 

*now do they? It's all stoopid 80?86 (tho the 68000 series had a kinda similar 

*instruction set, MAC interfaces got in the fucking way all the time!) I gave 

*asm and puters the arse for a while, then I got into synthetic organic chem, 

*now I'm playing with the chemistry which powers the brain cells which

*think about the chemistry which powers the brain cells which think about the 

*chemistry which powers the brain cells which think about the chemistry which 

*powers the brain cells which think about the chemistry which powers the

*A biohack for you: A biotech corp is selling proprietary plasmids (circles 

*of DNA). These come with code for the construction of an enzyme which

*protects bacteria against attack by an expensive antibiotic, which of course 

*the company also sells. People use the plasmid inside bacteria; to select for 

*bacteria which have taken in the plasmid, they to grow the bacteria on

*food with the poisonous antibiotic in it. So, bacteria with the plasmid in 

*them live, the rest die. 



*It is achievable with much cheaper antibiotics, and an acquaintance had the 

*shits with this sort of profiteering greed so typical of corporate biotech

*beancounter-think.



*So he set a project for one of his students - cut the plasmid with an enzyme 

*which cut the DNA strand, twice, slightly offset from the ends of the

*resistance gene for the costly antibiotic. Then was spliced in, in the same 

*place, the DNA coding for a really cheap antibiotic.



*That's a simple explanation, and avoids technical crap related to keeping 

*reading frames, finding compatible cut sites, and DNA ligation protocols.

*So, worry not; when Micro$oft, Merck, Novartis, and Mon$anto claim to "own"

*strains of plants (absolute freeware-theft, if you ask me!), or "own"

*biochemical pathways which are just slight modifications of the natual

*biological freeware on this planet, remember, there are molec-bio hackers  

*out there, silently doing just what you do, but using nucleotide bases, not 

*logical bits, to do it, and getting no media attention at all either.



*Free the code.

*Point an eyeball at Monod, Jaques: "Chance and Necessity", particularly

*the "Microscopic Cybernetics" chapter and those successive thereto.

*At this point I feel nowhere near the levels of proficiency which would

*earn me a --, let alone + from HCU. Compared to hex cracking and reversing, 

*bio has only very crude tools. We only got PCR to copy specific DNA strands 

*ten years ago. We can build sequenced DNA, to 100 bases. Whoo-fucking-pee.

*Worse, almost none of the people here have any idea why they're doing molbio,

*they're zombies... getting them to realise the nature of The System is next

*to impossible... they read the newspapers, watch TV, consume, be silent, die.



*I am one of the few who have jettisoned the humanocentricity memesystem, and 

*I for one have no particular attachment to being harboured in the standard

*H.sapiens processor, and would long to exist and evolve in digital form,

*effectively immortal. As some of you would understand, I feel somewhat alone,

*misunderstood by those with whom I research. Hacking my chassis is a long 

*way off yet... much to learn, and new tools need to be developed. As it is,

*we have lots of things to chop DNA, and join DNA, and even find out what

*a sequence is (5'-GAGACTTAGCTTAGGGCTAAAATTCGATCTC-3' for example)... but 

*we lack decompilers (the Edman degradation is the closest we have) and

*similar tools. Retrofitting the billions of pre-existing somatic cells which

*comprise my neural accommodation (brain) and its support system (carcass)

*is beyond my reach just yet. It is slow work. I have one advantage: the 

*language is pretty much standard across animals, plants, fungi, bacteria, 

*etc. One platform, one language... the language in which my platform is 

*written. Further: viri I write infect the human substrate if I so choose.... 

*but they need not be destructive. I can write payloads which can lift

*burdens from the ill - changing the warheads if you like - and draft old 

*enemies into allies. The pharmo companies don't like this, because it might 

*lower the $ they earn from dispensing expensive continual patch-up cures. 



*In any case, I wonder if greedy, stoopid humanity deserves this help.

*Darwinian selection should be allowed to operate freely. If my suspicions 

*about distributed systems failure (as a result of the Y2K problem) are

*correct, Darwin will laugh once more, and it will echo loudly in our ears.



*Reverse + universe = re-uni-verse (to make everything one again).



*Recursion and self-reference make the universe go around. And around.



*A molecular biologist is a genome's way of knowing about genomes. 



*It is not accidental that my pseudonym is designated an EBNF notation for

*a symbolic object. I bid you <U>code well</U>, brothers and sisters of the 

*electronic universe. Kind regards to all of you from my desolate, glittering 

*and intricate universe of molecular meatware. Brevity aside, it is good to 

*have met you.
