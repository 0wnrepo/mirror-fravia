Where should I begin? The fact is that there are not so many information about +ORC, who 

seems to be a very peculiar guy. I tried to stalk him for a long time, I have given up 

now. From some private letters that he has sent to some of his students, we got the impression 

of a middle-aged retired university professor, &quot;reversing&quot; expert, pretty often abroad 

(for linguistic and/or cracking studies). I think he could be Dutch,

but I'm not sure, that's only a theory of my wife, which speaks 

Dutch and told me that some of the patterns he uses point in

that direction. This has been confirmed by many Dutch readers of this page.<br>

 Another interesting theory is that he is US military... any hint

 from any of you is welcomed, there is quite a lot of 'Orcstalking' 

going on, as I can vouch reading the letters I receive on this 

subject.<br>On the web there are 

some specialised sites for &quot;+ORC's stalking&quot;, the best one is IMO

<br><hr><h2>A history of my first contact</h2>

<br>

As soon as I saw the first 

lessons by +ORC, 

back in the winter of 1995, I understood that a new dawn was possible (at least among 

crackers :-) if enough of them  

would have understood and carried his tutorial and his simple (but incredibly deep) message:

</i><pre>&quot;knowledge is now free at last, everything should be free from now on, 

enjoy knowledge and life and work for everybody else&quot;</pre><i>I was 

also struck by the affinities between my own ideas and +ORC's philosophy.<br><br>

+ORC's approach, in choosing &quot;cracking&quot; (the busting of software protections) as a channel 

through which his ideas could be at least partly diffused was 

simply genial: There you had on one side a huge community of very  clever talented 

young people, with an incredible thirst for knowledge, which could NEVER be satisfied by 

a society mainly intent in transforming them in silly consumer guinea pigs, and there you 

had, on the other side, our magnificent Web, growing with an incredible momentum: 

the perfect media 

for free &quot;forbidden&quot; and &quot;half-anonymous&quot; knowledge spreading. A high explosive cocktail indeed!<br><br>

The developments of the last    

years, with the incredible 

growth of the &quot;+ORC's students&quot; section, seems to confirm that +ORC has indeed 

thrown a lot of seeds in the wind! :-)<br><br>

His tutorial is now (November 1997) partly obsolete. The incredibly rash 

development of the 

+HCU has given results that went beyond any possible forecast. The +HCU is certainly 

not &quot;a group of crackers&quot;. It is a loose association of reverse engineers, crackers 

and protectors 

(yeah, as strange as it may seem :-) without affiliation or affiliated to one of the many different 

existing groups. The +HCU  publishes each year (in April) a &quot;strainer&quot; for admission to 

the subsequent year courses, strainer which is in turn mainly an excuse to check the 

identity of the applicants and a guarantee, 

for those who get through it, to have their merit emphasised. The +HCU is nowadays, through 

his many <a href="student.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/student.htm">projects</a> and the more than 400 <a href="academy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/academy.htm">essays</a>, 

a real free &quot;Academy&quot; of software reverse engineering (the 

only one on the Web) whose documents are eagerly awaited (and read) by many &quot;professional&quot; 

reverse engineer around the world. Judging from the postings I have received in recent 

times there is a growing &quot;official&quot; recognition of our work, an activity that a 

couple of years ago could still have been dismissed as simple (silly) 'protection cracking'. All this has been 

made possible by +ORC, and I (among many others) will NEVER forget it.<br><br>+ORC has 

partly retired. You'll be able to read <a href="academy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/academy.htm">here</a> a letter he wrote us. 

Last contact we had he was currently cracking ancient languages (or so 

it seemed to +gthorne and me, yet with +ORC 

you never know what's real and what's faked) and did  promise 

his couple of 

lessons about Zen-cracking 

for the +HCU courses. On 29 October 1997 (also long ago in web-time :-( 

he wrote another 

<a href="newuni.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/newuni.htm">letter</a> about the organisation of teh following year's +HCU courses, 

where he did not 

give the impression of a &quot;retired cracker&quot; (whatever that means) and seemed 

intentioned to work a lot... so who knows what he had for...<br><br>

I'm not only an +ORC student, I am an official +ORC's fan. I like a lot what 

he called &quot;reality cracking&quot;, and 

I wish could elaborate more and better on those matters. Some of +ORC's 

contributions seem to me particularly outstanding, like 

his now famous essay about supermarket <a href="slaves.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/slaves.htm">enslavement</a> 

techniques (you'll never 

see again your own supermarket with the same eyes once you read that :-) and his 

cracking (and a little shady :-) absolute masterpiece about 

<a href="howto92/index.html" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howto92/index.html">codebar</a> techniques.<br>

In fact I believe 

that the &quot;reality cracking&quot; done by +ORC (see for 

instance also his <a href="modernze.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/modernze.htm">modern 

Zen</a> essays) is a QUITE important deed, superior even to his famous tut, and will acquire a more and 

more important role -for us all- in the near future.<br>

<br>

For many years +ORC used a bilateral channel on the never forgotten 

anon.penet.fi server, until 

this (famous) server was closed down. We did not have (almost) any contact for a 

whole year, and then, 

on 21 August 1997, he reopened a bilateral channel where you could  

email him: <a href="mailto:orc__@hotmail.com">orc__@hotmail.com</a>.

<br><font color="red">WARNING!</font>... he wrote that he did not  

intend to answer any email that wasn't coming from an +HCU student:</i> 

<pre>&quot;I'll answer ONLY to old or new +crackers, though&quot;</pre><i>This should

 have kept him pretty busy anyway for a while, since, as 

you have probably already seen, on my site there are more than 400 

different essays written by <u>a couple of hundreds</u> of more or 

less official &quot;students&quot;.<br>Many authors, 

as you may have noticed, use now a &quot;+&quot;, inside their handle, as a form of respect 

towards +ORC, yet not everyone of them took part to the +HCU courses: every year 

+ORC publishes (usually in April) a &quot;strainer&quot; for the admission to the 

following year's +HCU's courses.<br>I passed the strainer in 1996 and 

worked in a &quot;unit&quot; (as fravia+) together with +Sync and +gthorne.<br>

Basically, we got +his lessons &quot;in advance&quot;, in order to 'polish'

and at times we had to 'finish' them (see as an example lesson 9.3). 

I suspect he was just too 

lazy to finish them himself :-)<br>

 The &quot;strainer&quot; that had to be solved in order to access the +HCU 1998 was 

 published in April 1997 inside +ORC's lesson <a href="howto42/index.html" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howto42/index.html">4.2.</a>, all readers 

had time to solve it until 15 September 1997.<br>The 

<img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0"><a href="solution.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/solution.htm">solutions</a> to this strainer 

 have been published and represent a very interesting reading for reverse 

engineering studies: more than 10 good reversers have worked on the SAME three 

(Micro$oft's) protection schemes, tackling them from ALL possible angles, an 

execrcise of &quot;comparated cracking&quot; that nobody else, I believe has ever done 

until now... and that demonstates the amazing Web potentialities for &quot;group work&quot; in reversing 

and other matters :-)<br>

<br>If you want to learn more about +ORC -besides visiting the Basilisk's page- 

you may enjoy reading some of the letters that he has sent around: in the one from <a href="academy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/academy.htm">21 

August 1997</a>  

he seems to be happy with our work :-) and less and less interested in cracking and 

more and more interested in what he calls &quot;reality cracking&quot;, in the one from <a href="newuni.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/newuni.htm">29 

October 1997</a> he writes about the organisation of the +HCU courses for 1998. I hope 

that Dominique will send me a copy of +ORC's letter about &quot;power and the internet&quot;, 

that I would like to publish, since at the moment I have not a complete version of it.

As you could read above, there is a page of &quot;the

dedicated, among other things, to the above riddle. The Basilisk expresses there his 

convictions about the location of +ORC's next gate (he has made a huge work on this and  

many of the tools he has used in order to stalk +ORC's hidden gates are explained and 

very useful indeed). If you want to contribute to the great

 &quot;riddle solving&quot; contact him, I personally have given it up, the possible permutations 

seem to me too many (may be I'm not &quot;simple&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot; enough :-)<br>If +ORC had 

really a site somewhere, I believe that by now somebody would have found it... and upon 

consideration I don't believe that the two pages found by the Basilisk are 

really +ORC's gates (or, if they are, they are beyond my comprehension :-(</i>

Orc+ in India (January 1999)



                 Hi Fravia+,



                 I am a cracker/reverser from India , i really enjoy

                 reading the stuff on your fravia site.

                 This might interest you : 

                 A magazine called &quot;Software Review&quot; published here in

                 India from a place called Hyderabad ,

                 has serialized Orc+ 's cracking lessons. The first of

                 his lessons (on the pooldemo.exe game),

                 appeared in the November '98 issue , the next issue

                 carried in December the subsequent lesson. (I havent

                 seen the Jan 99 issue) . Probably this is the first 

		 time that the great Orc+'s works have been published 

                 in a &quot;proper&quot; software magazine!



                 Regards,

                 Maharaja </pre>
