Hi Fravia,



I have been following your site for the last one month, all that I can

say is: its Fantabulous!!

I have read the articles on CGI scripts cracking, but ASP (Active Server

Pages) cracking doesnt seem to have been discussed till now.   

So I thought I should write something about this 'technology' from 

our Micro$oft's friends...

Active Server Page reversing

<BR><BR>

By Indian Maharaja

<BR><BR>



Tools Required :

<BR><BR>

Nothing but your browser .

<BR><BR>



When M$ launched Windoze NT server, it was trying to compete against

existing

Unix platforms.<BR><BR>

Since Billy boy couldnt make much progress he had this idea of

'bundling'

software, to snare 

people who thought that all the software was for 'free'.

<BR><BR>

One of the many bloatwares that were launched were SQL-Server (an

abomination

of a rdbms), 

IIS (Internet Info server).  Now M$ decided CGI was a worthless

technology

(since they couldnt 

control it) , so they laucnhed something called ISAPI (Internet Server

Api). <BR><BR>

If you look, at

the documentation for IIS, it mentions full support for CGI, but you

will find

the documentation 

littered with references as to why Isapi is a million times greater and

better

than CGI.<BR><BR>

Lets prove the opposite..:-)

<BR><BR>

So what really is Asp ? Its availlable for download from the M$

website, but

it requires 

IIS or PWS (personal web server installed). (Install Exe is 9Megs+  if

this

isnt bloatware

at its best then I am not maharaja).<BR><BR>

Basically Asp is a wrapper on Isapi and allows server side scripting

using

VeeBee Script 

or JavaScript (sorry JScript -- m$ version of Javascript).

<BR><BR>

A vey simple asp script is some thing like :

<PRE>

&lt;HTML&gt;

&lt;%Response.Write("Hello")%&gt; 

&lt;/HTML&gt;



which will result in a htm =&gt;  



&lt;HTML&gt;

Hello

&lt;/HTML&gt;

</PRE>

which is downloaded to the clients machine, so if I do a view source I

can see

only the 

resultant HTM , and not the Asp code as this translated to HTM on the

server

and then sent.

<BR><BR>

So what people generally do is keep all the code for validating

Passwords,

redirecting to 

hidden pages inside the Asp file , and based on some user input show

only the

required 

things to the user. Even if the user does a view-source he can see only

the

downloaded htm.

It would be very nice if we could see the Asp source...

<BR><BR>

There are very many sites using Asp and still more sites using Isapi

Dlls. <BR><BR>

Since Asp 

is a wrapper (a filter as the documentation says) on Isapi, it is

possible to

write Dlls using 

VeeCee++ (ver 5.0 has an App-wizard option for that) and Mfc which can

provide

lower level 

functionality.

<BR><BR>

If you find a page like this www.indianmaharaja.com/default.asp =&gt;

bulls-eye

this site uses 

Asp.

<BR><BR>

If you find a page like this

www.indianmaharaja.com/validate.dll?12473636 =&gt;

most probably it 

is an Isapi dll.

<BR><BR>

So lets get down to business...

<BR><BR>

1)  if you are on an Asp page do this :

	www.indianmaharaja.com/default.asp::$DATA

	You will find that either the Asp code is dispalyed in your browser

window

(or)

	a download window pops up which allows you to download the Asp.

	

<BR><BR>

So much for code security.

	It seems its a bug in Isapi and a fix is availlable at m$ sites.

	All the micro$oft sites have run this fix :-( . But I found many-many

other

web sites , 

	who are still running the unfixed version :-).

<BR><BR>

 

2)	Next I checked out a site which was using an Isapi dll, I tried

doing this

:<BR><BR>

	www.indianmaharaja.com/validate.dll 

	(entering just the name of the dll) -- nope i got a message :

	'Hackers keep off'

	Too bad, so I tried the trick specified in 1)

	www.indianmaharaja.com/validate.dll::$DATA

	Bingo ! I was able to download the dll.

	 <BR><BR>

	I racked my brains as to how such a HUGE security hole could be there,

I

still havent 

	been able to figure it out.  Most probably it is because of lousy

coding done

by the M$ 

	loving bozos or it was there for some devious reason known only to M$.

<BR><BR>

3)	The story doesnt end here ...  my next assignment was of running Asp

on

Apache 	Server 

	for NT.  M$ never provided a version of Asp (i.e.Isapi) for web

servers other

than 

	IIS.  A company called ChilliSoft provides a version called ChilliAsp

which

runs on 

	Apache for NT(I dont know why anybody would want to run Asp in the 1st

place). <BR><BR>

	ChilliAsp availlable for download from M$'s site builder network site.

	Now if you have an Asp file with a long file name say :

	<BR><BR>

	www.indianmaharaja.com/passwordval.asp

<BR><BR>

	if you type the short file name in the browser

<BR><BR>

	www.indianmaharaja.com/passwo~1.asp -- unbelievably the download

window pops

up and you 

	can download the asp script.

	I have noticed this problem only in the apache version of asp.  Though

a fix

might be 

	availlable now ( i am not sure), there could be many sites....

<BR><BR>



4)	One more screwup -- that is most commonly done by the person who

wrote the

Asp scripts ,

	Sometimes when I do a view source of a .asp file in my browser I get

something like this 

	along with just the html :

<PRE>

	&lt;!--#include file = "inc/encrypt.inc"--&gt;

	&lt;!--#include file = "inc/AdminChk.inc"--&gt;

	&lt;HTML&gt;

	.

	.

	Other stuff

	.

	.

	&lt;/HTML&gt;	

	</PRE>

	What the bozo who created the page has done is include some common

.asp code

(like 

	validation routines which are used across pages) in a .inc file .

	Now if the page being viewed was :

	www.indianmaharaja.com/login.asp

	<BR><BR>

	just type in :

	www.indianmaharaja.com/inc/encrypt.inc

	<BR><BR>

	your browser will promptly download this file . 

	Open the file and you have something like this :

	<PRE>

	&lt;SCRIPT RUNAT=SERVER&gt;

	Function Encrypt(theStr)	

	..

	..

	..

	End Function

	&lt;/SCRIPT&gt; 

</PRE>

	what you will see is the complete asp code.

<BR><BR>

Hope you find this information useful in the continuing battle against

billy's

boys at Micro$oft.
