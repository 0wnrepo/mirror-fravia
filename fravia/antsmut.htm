So you want to access some parts of a site that your not supposed to

eh ?  There are usually only a few ways that sites restrict access to

their page.



Password Access

-CGI/Other Scripting 

-Javascript







First of all Password access, the easiest way is to search for a

password to this page.  Try altavista with the search string +"site

name" +password.  This will sometimes turn up pages of disgruntled

users who have paid for this site and dislike it, they are now set on

revenge and the only way they can do this is to let other people use

their login/password.  This might not yield anything but if it does it

is the easiest way to gain access.



Next check for the kind of Password access, if you view the source and

see something like 

&lt;form method="post" action="<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/login/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/login/'" tppabs="http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/login/" target=_blank>http://www.server.com/cgi-bin/login</A>?"&gt;

Then you can assume this page is protected by a CGI-script and you

won't have a very good chance of getting in.  You can however try

default usernames/passwords for this site.  Try leaving both fields

blank and hitting ok, then try user/pass and then any other

combinations of likely logins you can think of, anonymous/guest,

fred/fred, 1234/1234, etc.



Perhaps though you go to the page and click to enter and the login box

looks different than most other sites do.  This is a tip-off that it

is "protected" by javascript.  Not much of a protection, usually the

password will be hard-coded into the source.  Do a view-source and see

where it checks the user/pass.  It will have some kind of if statement

and possible some long string of text of seemingly random characters. 

This is just a front to "encode" the password so it is not obvious. 

There will either be a custom function or they will use the default

function to retrieve only certain characters from the long string,

this is the password. For example consider this pseudocode:



if (username=getletter(12) + getletter(1) + getletter(7)) {



do whatever



}





This is obviously checking your input with the strings returned by

getletter.  Look around and see if you see something like



getletter(int x) {

return mid(bwertyucopasadfghjklzxcvbnm,x,1)

}



The 1 probably means return only one character starting at x.  So you

count over 12 letters and get "a", 1 letter is "b", and 7 letters is

"c".



The password is "abc".



Another technique with javascript it the document.open function.  It

opens a page, they simply use the user input as the argument for

document.open, so it opens whatever you enter.  The password will be

the name of the html page.  There is really no way to get past this

other than by guessing the correct page name.



If you are trying to get into a page and it is hosted on another site

as in the case of www.server.com/users/~jobob/page.html

and you want to access files in this directory try to go to

www.server.com/users/~jobob/.  Sometimes this will let you list all

the files in that directory provided there is not a default file to

open.  This is a useful technique for all kinds of pages, simply take

the html file name off the end of the url and see what happens, you

can find out many things this way.



Also try an ftp search, there are some isp's, webcom.com comes to

mind, that put all your files in a world-readable directory on their

ftp thus you can login to ftp.server.com/users/jobob and see a listing

and download all of his files.  This rarely works but when it does it

is an easy way to access a page.



A real backdoor that works is at www.bondage.com.



Go to the guest section.  Click the searchable pic database, notice

the .asp as the page extension.  This stands for Active Server Page

and means MS's CGI-Wannabe Scripting Language.  Look around especially

at the limitations of the guest level that everyone is at.  It says

you are allowed to download 5 images per day.  Search for any image,

now notice what it returns to you.  Notice the file names are listed,

this wouldn't be that bad except for something else we are about to

find out. Click a file name and it links to

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.bondage.com/show_pic.asp?id=somenumber  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.bondage.com/show_pic.asp?id=somenumber'" tppabs="http://www.bondage.com/show_pic.asp?id=somenumber" target=_blank>http://www.bondage.com/show_pic.asp?id=somenumber</A>

All this tells us is that there is a database somewhere the file names

indexed by their id number.  The image should be loading on your

screen.  Do a copy image address.  

You should get

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/filename.jpg  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/filename.jpg'" tppabs="http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/filename.jpg" target=_blank>http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/filename.jpg</A>



Wait, isn't file name the same filename that was on the search page ?

Go back and select another picture and this time copy the filename and

append it to <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/'" tppabs="http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/" target=_blank>http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/</A>



Thus you get <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/newfilename.jpg  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/newfilename.jpg'" tppabs="http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/newfilename.jpg" target=_blank>http://www.bondage.com/sortedpictures/newfilename.jpg</A>,

now go here and you can view the image.  Then go back and click on the

regular link to an image.  You get the msg, This ip address has

downloaded 1 image today.  It didn't count the file we linked to

directly, this is your exploit.  You can view any image as long as you

just go to the filename and no through the asp script file.
