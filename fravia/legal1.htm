<P>

Good Evening +Fravia,

<BR><BR>

I am The+Starling (although it shouldn't take you too long to determine

my

real name).  You were asking for help on the legal aspects of reverse

engineering.  Here are my thoughts 

<BR><BR>

THE LEGAL PROTECTION OF COMPUTER PROGRAMS

<BR><BR>

Introduction

<BR><BR>

Although I'm not connected with the legal profession I thought I'd have

a go

at exploring the issues to do with one of +Fravia's questions on the

legality

of reverse engineering from a layman's perspective.  To answer the

question

I'm going to talk about EEC law, specifically the text of the

Council Directive of 14 May 1991 on the legal protection of computer

programs

(91/250/EEC).  Because it's EEC law, most of this probably doesn't

apply in

the States (sorry fellas) and please bear in mind that because this is

the text of the Directive, some of the portions of the actual

Directive

could be different.  So, down to business .. the article consists of a

discussion of what I think are the three most important bits of the

Directive,

Article 5(1), Article 5(3) and Article 6.  I've also mentioned Article

9(1) in

passing.  It'll probably help if you've read at least thesee from the

directive.  One last thing, during the course of the article I'll refer

to

"the author" quite a bit.  When I say "the author" I mean either the

person,

or the people, or the company that sold you the program - it's a legal

term

that's definined in the Directive.  I guess I don't have to say that

because

I'm not a lawyer or solicitor or whatever, you shouldn't take any of

this as

legal advice.  If you're in legal trouble you really need to get help

from a

professional.

<BR><BR>



Discussion

<BR><BR>

You may fix bugs unless the license says otherwise - Article 5(1)

You are legally entitled to do "anything you like" (sic) to a program

to fix

it if and only if it doesn't work and the license agreement doesn't say

otherwise.  So if the license that comes with your nice new software

contains

a clause that says something like "you can't fix my heap of shit if it

breaks

then you are not legally entitled to take it to pieces and fix it. 

However if

the license doesn't say what to do if the program's faulty then you can

translate, adapt, arrange or alter the program in order to get it to

work: but

you are not legally entitled to do any of those four things for any

other

purpose (because it's a challenge, say).

<BR><BR>

You may observe, study or test a program's functioning - Article 5(3)

Regardless of what the license agreement says, you don't need to have

permission from the program's author (the "authorization of the

rightholder"),

to study the way a program works (it's "functioning") if and only if

your aim

is to understand the "ideas and principles" which underlie the part of

the

program you're studying.  Anything in your contract that says you can't

study,

observe or test the program's functioning is declared "null and void" by

Article 9.  However if it can be proved that in studying the program

you've

infringed laws on "trade-marks, unfair competition, trade secrets,

protection

of semi-conductor products or other laws of contract" you may be liable

to

prosecution.  This might mean that if you go studying a program and

you've

accepted the license agreement for it you can be found in breach of

contract

(because you may have infringed "other laws of contract").  However

because

contract law is fantastically complicated (even more so than +Fravia's

site

:-) you'd need a specialist to look and decide whether studying a

particular

program constitutes a breach of the license conditions for that program.

<BR><BR>

	It's now time to touch on the important question to do with

Article5(3).  It

is: when you reverse engineer a program are you studying it?  In other

words,

does reverse engineering constitute a legitimate area of study?  If it's

legitimate then it should be okay to reverse any program you like as

long as

you're doing it to study the program and not for some other reason.  I

don't

think there's a hard and fast answer to this question.  On the face of

it I

can't think of any reason why reverse engineering should be

illegitimate per

se:  it's just another area of computer science/engineering like any

other and

every area of study requires subject matter.  But there are questions

to do

with a person's intent when they reversed a product which would need to

be

answered in a legal case.  In other words, in order to decide whether

your

reversing is legit you probably need to look at your motives for

reversing a

program:  do you do it for profit or because you want to understand how

it

works?  If the latter then you are potentially on better ground than if

it

were the former.  If you really are interested in how a protection

scheme

works and you're not trying to crack it so you can sell, or give, the

resulting program to others, then a court of law would be inclined to

look

more favourably on you.  However you would need to provide proof of your

intention: just saying so wouldn't be enough.  Publicising your results

on a

Web page with the heading "FREE CRACKED PROGRAMS" would definitely not

be good

idea.  Neither would public vitriolic rantings aimed at the author

because it

might be apparent that your aim was not to understand the program but to

damage the author's "legitimate interest", i.e. you cracked the program

because you wanted to harm their business in some way.  For example,

saying 

"Micro$haft are demonically intent on possessing people's souls and I

love to

break their programs because it gives me pleasure" to your friends is

fine,

but when you publish a web page you put your opinions in the public

domain. <BR>

At that point you really must be prepared to put your money where your

mouth

is - if you really have an informed opinion then it should be possible

to

persuade a reasonable group of people that you are right.  However if

you're

just mouthing off all you'll do is make yourself look like a berk and

you'll

demean the credibility of your contention that you were seeking

understanding.

<BR><BR>

see <A href="#anchornote1">note 1</A>!

<BR><BR>

You may decompile a program if it's not "interoperable" with other

programs -

Article 6

You are legally entitled to decompile a program if and only if it's

necessary

to "achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer

program

with other programs", but not for any other purpose.  A program is not

interoperable if it "gets in the way" of other programs on your

computer.  By

this I mean that it must obstruct another program's execution on

purpose, or

hog so much memory that nothing else can get a look in on purpose, or

refuse

to relinquish control to Windows on purpose, and so on.  A program is

perfectly interoperable if it's a bit slow, or buggy, or the executable

is a

bit larger than it need be.  Interoperability has to do with deliberate

obstruction rather than bugs.  So if your snazzy new $oftICE program

has a

virus in it that causes it to destroy the M$Explorer executable, you're

perfectly at liberty to take it to bits and stop it doing that.  But if

IExplore.exe is feeling a bit poorly today and you're pissed off with

it, you

are not legally entitled to hack it around in order to speed it up a

little. 

When you decompile a program, you are only allowed to alter that bit of

it

that's causing it not to be interoperable.  So if you're fixing that

virus in

$oftICE you can't go altering the protection scheme at the same time

(unless

it's that that's causing the trouble of course :-).

<BR><BR>



Conclusion

<BR><BR>

I think the law is fairly clear as far as fixing bugs and making a

program

work alongside other programs goes.  But it looks like the waters are

muddy as

far as reversing a program in order to study it goes.  Intention (as

ever)

appears to be 9/10ths of the law in this case.  Having said that it may

be

that a lawyer would be able to clarify points of my interpretation, but

then

again it might be that the law is unclear on this point and it would

require a

judgement to sort the matter out.

<BR><BR>



Au Revoir oh my brothers.  Fight ignorance.

Cracker, reverse thyself

<A name="anchornote1"></A>

Note 1: I'm sure this final set of opinions will look pedestrian to some

people.  Perhaps they are.  I just think that if we're really

interested in

defending reverse engineering as legitimate subject for study (rather

than

just saying "up yours" to corporations because they happen to have

incurred

our displeasure) we'll need to start putting some reasoned argument

behind

rhetorical statements like "You may bomb or nuke only sites and pages

that are

really lame and/or pathetically commercial-oriented" otherwise we'll

make

ourselves look like arses rather than searchers :-)
