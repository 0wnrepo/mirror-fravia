<H2>Common propaganda techniques</H2>

<H3>(applied reversing in the context of  the NATO aggression<A href="#aggr">*</A> of Yugoslavia)</H3>



By fravia+ (April 1999 ~ in fieri ~ version 003)

<HR width=44%>

Note that there is a Mid-May addition to this 'thread' by nonetheless than Tapu<BR><A href="tapunato.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tapunato.htm">Cracking The  World War III Show:  A War Without

 Good Guys</A>

</CENTER><HR>

<B>1. Introduction</B><P>

Since this script is intended for a "mature" audience (i.e., readers that are -or should be-

able to discern propaganda patterns in order to practice their reality cracking skills), let's

put immediately out of the way some useless "pavlovian reaction" patterns. I hope not to be

annoyed by people

accusing me of being either filo-serbian or filo-NATO. I'm not: I'm convinced that both

Milosevic and Clinton are corrupt criminals, a statement that seems pretty evident to me not

only in the context of this war, and -moreover- I strongly believe that <U>all soldiers</U> are

killers ("Soldaten sind m–rder", a beautiful and very precise reversing statement by Kurt

Tuckholsky).

<P>

Let's also, please, put aside the obvious truths <BR> <B>1) </B>that the Serbian and the

Kossovars are both

practicing ethnic cleansing (like everyone else nowadays... and not only in the

Balcans);<BR><B>2) </B>

that NATO has waged an aggression

war without any legal or democratic justification whatsoever (and given itself 

the right to attack sovereign nations at whim); <BR><B>3) </B> that after four

weeks of

bombing the military, strategical and political incompetence of the NATO forces is evident from

Lissabon to Novosibirsk; and that

<BR><B>4) </B> that the real victims of this war are mostly Serbian <B>and</B> Kossovars

women, children and elderly.



<P>

What I'm concerned with is the propagandistic aspect of this war.

I'll analyze some English-speaking newspapers only, because I cannot understand Serbo-Croatian

(else I would have gladly analyzed the Serbian propaganda as well). Note that I tried to introduce some 

aspects of Serbian propaganda where I could find some english speaking fonts. I hope that 

Serbian readers will send me an investigation of their country's own propaganda patterns.<BR>German,

French, Italian (or whatever) readers could also send me short lists of the main adjectives

used on their media to describe the 'resilient dictator Milosevic' and those 'slaughtering and

killing serbs', with their 'terror tactics'.<BR>

It would also be useful to collect the main paraphrases used to describe those "heroic

aviators" and "law enforcers" which are "trying to carry out a mission to save 

the refugee's lives" bombing people around in the Balcans. A list of all euphemisms used in the 

various european languages (see the 'collateral damages' part of this essay) would, 

I'm sure, be quite interesting as well.<P>

I don't need to point out that, in the tradition of my site, this kind of work will florish if 

people will contribute reversing on their own: building on each other's shoulders we will 

send another snowball downhill :-)<HR width=44%>

<B>Caveats</B><BR>

Since I'll analyse the NATO-propaganda, this script will <B>seem</B> biased towards the Serbian

part. There's unfortunately no way to avoid it (short of knowing Serbo-Croatian and

performing an analogouos exercise on their propaganda). I don't care much, since I believe

the NATO-Governments to be (and not only in this context) hypocritical criminals exactly

as much as the Serbian one probably is (though I admit to lack any direct experience there),

so I don't believe I'm betraying anyone, quite the countrary... in any war the real

act of courage is to disert, and if, as I agree, "soldiers are killers",  then

"disertors are heroes".<P>

Anyway the duty of a reverser is to reverse. And -as you will see- this "schm¸tzig NATO/Serbia-krieg" 

will offer us plenty of material to flex our reversing muscles.



<P><B>

2) It's all propaganda, don't doubt it for a minute

</B><P>

A great danger, when examining propaganda material, is a sort of 'subliminal contamination', a slow grip 

that that same material is getting onto you, notwithstanding all your reverser' defences. So let's 

not forget for a minute that all what we are been told about this event (as usual) is just 

propagandistic crap. To dig out some small truths requires, as you'll see, a lot of reversing 

stamina.<P>



On 19/4/99 Joe Lockhart, the White House spokesman, told reporters at a Washington briefing to

be

"<FONT color=blue>more skeptical</FONT>" of Belgrade's claims. Reacting to suggestions that he, too, was engaged in

propaganda, Mr. Lockhart said that he was trying "<FONT color=blue>to put the best face on things, but Belgrade

is simply engaged in outright lies about developments on the ground</FONT>".

<P>

This very interesting statement puts us straight in the middle of the question: while our

side tries to 'put the best face on things', the enemy is 'engaged in outright lies'.

<P>

You could also read the following on the Herald Tribune:<BR>

"Losing the information war is a prime concern in Brussels. For several weeks, NATO has been

sustained by moral outrage over ragged refugees on the run from slaughter. Support for the

allied assault is high in most Western countries. But recent days delivered a double whammy of

adverse images: 10 civilians killed in a passenger train bombed by NATO and the tractor convoy

bombing Wednesday. '<FONT color=blue>Milosevic hopes he can soak up punishment, and through outrage over

collateral damage, he can win the propaganda campaign</FONT>', a NATO diplomat said".

<P>

"...through outrage over collateral damage", we will find this 'collateral damage' again in

the Euphemisms section below. But the "soak up punishment" part is also a masterpiece of

propaganda. Goebbels would be proud of this unnamed NATO-diplomat.

<P>

Do not underestimate the importance of propaganda in this context: as the Economist (351: 24/30 April) reports:<BR><BR> 

"<FONT color=blue>To most people in the main western democracies, the reports from Kosovo of torture, rape, looting and 

summary killings are so horrific that defeating Belgrade has seemed more important than any nicety 

of international law or diplomatic precedent</FONT>".<P>

This short period is a masterpiece of the deceiving art: a real truth hidden beneath (at least) 

three layers of rhetoric, and I'll let to the reader the pleasure (or 

rather the sad task) to reverse it. You will find hidden above <U>quite a lot</U> of keys (apart from "most", 

"report", "seem", "nicety" and "precedent").







<P>

<B>

3) Testimonials and Fear appeals

</B><P>

Testimonials usually represent the sugar-coating of a distortion, a falsehood, a misunderstood

notion.

The most common misuse of the testimonial involves citing individuals who are not qualified to

make judgments about a particular issue. Why should we regard this person as having trustworthy

information on the subject in question?

<P>

"<FONT color=blue>Refugees fleeing Kosovo are reporting to relief workers that Yugoslav helicopters and

airplanes have been attacking refugee convoys in the Serbian province, a Pentagon official

said.</FONT>" (Herald Tribune)

<P>

Now, the problem is that when you see an old man 'from Kossovo' lying in an 'Albanian' hospital

with a burned face, you are probably keen to believe that he barely escaped a 'serbian death

squadron', especially if he (seems to) say that. But there's no real proof whatsoever that what

he's saying is true, other that the fact that he's saying it and that he seems in very bad

conditions.  Note, that I'm not saying that he's in an Hollywood studio wearing tomatoes

make-up, in fact, everything he claims could really be true: the point is that the whole thing

is used for propaganda purposes, not in order to establish what happened, what if the

'helicopters and airplanes' were NATO's ones? (in fact much more probable given the air

superiority relations). Did the 'old man from Kossovo' recognize the markings of the attacking

planes, and would he have been interviewed if he really had?

<P>

Fear is a very strong propaganda method ("All other things being equal, the more frightened a

person is by a communication, the more likely her or she is to take positive preventive action"

- Pratkanis and Aronson, 1991), Fear appeals are more likely to succeed in changing behavior if

they contain specific

recommendations for reducing the threat that the audience believes are both effective and

doable. There are four elements to a successful fear appeal: 1) a threat, 2) a specific

recommendation about how the audience should behave, 3) audience perception that the

recommendation will be effective in addressing the threat, and 4) audience perception that they

are capable of performing the recommended behavior.

<P>

When confronted with persuasive messages that capitalize on our fear, we should ask ourselves

the following questions:<UL><LI>

Is the speaker exaggerating the fear or threat in order to obtain my support?<LI>

How legitimate is the fear that the speaker is provoking?<LI>

Will performing the recommended action actually reduce the supposed threat?<LI>

When viewed dispassionately, what are the merits of the speaker's proposal?</LI></UL>

<P>

The heavy use of testimonials must of course be accompanied by the discrediting of all

testimonials used by the adverse part. Here, after having reported a "serbian diffused"

propaganda interview with an hospital patient in Belgrad, a very curious comment by the Herald

Tribune: "<FONT color=blue>Belgrade had added another civilian casualty story in the propaganda war with the

North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and ordinary Serbs had been strengthened in their belief

that they - not the government of President Slobodan Milosevic - are the real victims of the

three-week-old bombing campaign against their country.</FONT>"

<P>Some reversing work is needed here, and it is very instructive to 

confront this with the "old man from Kossovo" story above.

<P><B>

4) Euphemisms

</B><P>

As all reversers (should) know, euphemisms are particularly abundant during wars. This has,

obviously, to do with the fact that wars are particularly unpleasant, since people tend to get

killed for very 'low' strategical scopes which vanish more and more into the background of the

'holy' cause the country you happen to fight for (or you just happen to live into) appears to

follow.

<P>

Note how -not so many years ago- the 'propagandistic' aspect was significantly less strong,

when you had also a Ministry (or a department) of war (and not a ministry, or department, 'of

defense'). Hence also missiles named 'peacekeeper' (an oxymoron if I ever saw one), traumatized

people suffering of 'combat fatigue' or of 'post-traumatic stress disorders' and so on.

<P>

'Collateral damages' seem to be one of the preferred euphemisms in this war.

<P>

Ah, yes: we have 'civilian casualties', as well, but those are always provoked by the other

side.

<P>

"<FONT color=blue>We know that civilian casualties are the objective of President Milosevic's policies</FONT>"<BR>

(James Rubin, the State Department spokesman).

<P>

And no,  still "<U>collateral damages</U>"... if seen from the Yugoslavian side:<P>

Vladislav Jovanovic (Yugoslavia's ambassador to the UN, October 1998, speaking 

about Yugoslavian repression in Kossovo): "<FONT color=blue>there is not any action or repression

against civilians by our forces. Our operation there exclusively centered and concentrated

against terrorists and their accomplices - it is possible that some <B>collateral damages</B> could

happen, and some civilians could be a reality, but it has never been done intentionally.</FONT>"

<P>

<B>

5) The case of the refugees bombing: screaming propaganda.

</B><P>

Since NATO pilots are bombing from more than 4,5 kilometers altitude, a series of 'collateral

damages' have obviously been pre-programmed. The most embarrassing blunder so far has been the

bombing of a convoy of the same refugees that the whole propaganda machine is supposed to

sanctify. The reactions of the killers as soon as this happened are extremely interesting:

<P><B>

First reaction:</B><BR>

It was not us, but the enemy that did it.

<P>

Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman, said that General Wesley Clark, the top NATO commander,

had received ''verbal reports of the possibility'' that, after military vehicles in the refugee

convoy were hit, ''military people got out'' and ''began to attack civilians in the middle of

the convoy.'' (Herald Tribune).

<P><B>

Second reaction:</B><BR>

It could have been us, but do not jump to any conclusion.

<P>

A NATO spokesman, Jamie Shea, acknowledged that ''military vehicles'' had been a target

Wednesday afternoon on the Prizren-Djakovica road in western Kosovo. He added that NATO was

trying to establish whether the convoy had been hit by mistake. ''We are processing the battle

damage assessment,'' he said. ''I would not jump to any conclusions until we've had a chance to

make an assessment,'' he said. ''Reserve judgment until we have the facts.'' Mr. Bacon said the

incident Wednesday was being investigated, which he said ''may take some time.'' ''We did hit

military vehicles in a convoy,'' he said. ''We are quite sure we hit only military vehicles. We

will obviously review what happened.'' (Herald Tribune)



<P><B>

Third reaction:</B><BR>

OK, it was us, but it was it was "an error occurred on the part of someone trying to carry out

a mission to save lives", not an 'atrocity': the real culprits are -of course- the enemies:

<P>

U.S. defense secretary, William Cohen (who has a grotesque sense of the grotesque):  "<FONT color=blue>For him

(Milosevic) to talk in terms of atrocities

when in fact he has caused the displacement and the refugee status of in excess of a million

people, where he has sent in 40,000 of his military, paramilitary, police, hooded thugs to

savagely kill and slaughter at random and on a wholesale basis these innocent people, for him

to talk about atrocities when <B>an error occurred on the part of someone trying to carry out a

mission to save their lives</B>, I think is one of the most grotesque statements that I could

conceive of.</FONT>"

<P>

Incredible but true. As if readers were zombies.

<P>

<B>Conclusion</B><BR>

The propaganda machine that has been started is a main component of this dirty NATO/Serbian war.<BR>

This same machine is now (after 4 weeks of bombing) running amok, as this snippet from 

"The Economist" (351: 24/30 April) testifies:<BR> 

<FONT color=blue>And now, having tried -so far with disastrous results- to stop the Serb 

atrocities by launching an air war, the alliance faces widespread criticism round the world for 

failing to get a licence from the United Nations and thus breaking international law</FONT>.

<BR>It would be difficoult -I believe- to find a more convolute 

(still propagandistic) statement to underline some obvious truths, 

a pleasure to reverse.

<P>

Our task, I believe, should be to study the <U>guts</U> of the propaganda machine 

(of course -if possible- on both 

sides) in order to learn, to understand and eventually -a far day from now 

I'm afraid- to be able to retaliate in

 the name of humanity. It is important to differentiate among those that are employed by the slavemasters to tame the 

zombies with writings and images: in fact  

there are "criminals", "responsables" and "gullible ones".  

What really amazes me is that 

there are incredibly few that dare point out some pretty obvious "inconsistencies". Seems like 

money plays a greater role than truth for writers and journalists :-)<BR>It 

would be quite interesting if all readers, in the States, in Germany, in Serbia, in Danemark 

and wherever, would work a little on their own media and send their own findings.

<BR>

There is 

no mistery in the art of deceiving people, of course.<BR> 

The great mystery is how so easily this is done and why so few care that it 

is being done. Anyway we are not discovering anything new...<BR>



"<I>Woe unto you, ...hypocrites! for ye make clean the outside of the cup and of 

the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess</I> " Matthew 23:25.

<P>

This work is still <I>in fieri</I> exactly as the war against Serbia is. Nato plans have 

been very well expressed by Clinton:

"<FONT color=blue>Our plan is to persist until we prevail</FONT>".

<P>

Those should be valid plans for all reversers as well :-)
