<HR> <I>Well, this good essay from Bozo concludes the whole project...<BR>Reading this essay I have two observations:<BR>1) I regret that Bozo doesn't &quot;go into the good and 

bad points&quot; of Winice, because such a discussion would be very useful and 

it is surely appropriate here, among people that knows this tool like 

nobody else :-)<BR>2) What about that &quot;dongle driver reverse engineering&quot;

Bozo speaks about? Hey Bozo, we have a running +HCU's project about dongles, don't you know it? 

Where is that essay? I want it! :-)</I></CENTER><HR><PRE><FONT size="+2"><B>Cracking of Winice for WinNT</B></FONT>



I have been looking, for a long... long time for WinIce for WinNT, 

since I am forced by other software to use it and I did not feel to 

install Windows 95 just to have Winice. 

When, at last, a trial version was made available at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#1'" tppabs="http://fravia.org/tppmsgs/msgs0.htm#1">Numega's site</A> 

I could not wait to crack it. 

Unfortunately the &quot;real&quot; reverse engineers were too fast for me. 

In any case... When Frog's first crack for WinIce for Windows95 became 

available, I tried it on my version, with a slight variation... and: 

BINGO... I found the code... changed it... and... PRESTO... it worked. 

When the following essays became available for WinIce for 

WinNT), I though to myself... crazy... what are these people talking 

about? Checksums and all... My copy of Winice for WinNT just works fine 

and I thought that the WinNT crackers went a little bit overboard.



In any case ... I used my homemade crack for Winice WinNT... and started 

cracking everything in sight. 

Well... to all crackers .. Winice has its good points and its bad ones, 

but I don't want to go into that. 

By the way: Wdasm, Urbanik's disassembler, is an excellent tool in its 

own right and has a definite place next to WinIce. 

Okay... back to reverse engineering WinIce for WinNT.



After a while I had to reformat my disk and reinstall WinIce. 

I made a backup with the intention to restore it to itsself. 

Later I decided to reinstall WinIce and that's were the s... hit the 

fan: My copy was not working any more! 

I could not find the code cracked by the +HCU's students in the essays, 

nothing worked any more... BUT IT HAD WORKED PREVIOUSLY! 

What went wrong? 

Checksum and the tootie came up... and no WinIce.



After a long cracking session and a lot of frustration, I decided to 

sit down and think back... 

Must be something with the installation, I thought, and tried various 

options... Automatic load, manual load, System load and, finally, load 

WinIce during booting. 

Now I remembered... I wanted to crack a dongle driver and that was how 

I installed it in the first place... in order to load it during the 

WinNT boot phase.



So what is the crack? Just perform the small (and obvious) crack below... 

and ensure that the WinIce driver is loaded <FONT color="red">during the boot phase</FONT>. 

No checksum... nothing... everything loads smoothly.



BTW. The loader32.exe and nmtrans.dll are identical to the first 

cracks regarding Win95, see the relevant essays.



Now read the following code and modify as indicated.

(NOTE: use in BOOT configuration else it will sumcheck and wont load)</B>

Okay .... thats it. There are a number of other cracks of mine, but 

those are mostly boring 2 minute jobs. 



Visual Basic still presents some problems though...



Greetings to all crackers and... keep them coming... 

Hopefully I get the time to share with you all some other techniques... 

there are a number of things I am working on... time permitting.



(Hope +ORC publishes soon another of his lessons... 

 <B>Whats happening, +ORC ....?)</B>
