        Well, I was wondering why I have not seen a unique protection scheme

in quite a while, so I decided to come up with one of my own.  I tried to

think of a straight ahead name/password scheme except to make the algorithm

really tricky.  However, since anyone with passing knowledge of assembly can

reverse this reasonably quickly, I decided to try to put a 'twist' on it.

What I came up with is, I believe, a challenging crack.  This is what I would

call a 'fairly strong' protection.  I did not Hackstop the program or put any

anti-debugger code in it, although I suspect that if I were actually trying to

protect this software I probably would have.  What I developed is, as far as I

am aware, the only 'MegaMan' type registration scheme around.  I call it

'MegaMan' because the old Nintendo games used to use a similar method for

entering codes.  My challenge to you is, crack it - but following a few

restrictions.  While a patch is always valid, and I would like to see how

some of you go about patching it, a valid code (or generator) will be the only

100% valid answer.  I know that since this program does not use the standard

API functions (GetWindowTextA etc.) to retrieve the password it will require

some research (possibly) into how windows retrieves the data.  I hope this

slows some of you down.  Realizing that this is a somewhat difficult crack, I

offer you 2 hints.

1.  The number of 'checks' is not always the same.  It CAN vary in length

        slightly depending on the name entered.

2.  THIS IS A HUGE CLUE - I will give you a valid name/number pair, so that

        you can see how the program reacts when a valid number is entered.

        The program acts no different, and no message box appears, so you

        cannot use a break on a window handle.

        Code:

                0 - H       \

                0 - C        |- HCU on line 0, pretty interesting.

                0 - U       /

                1 - S

                2 - M

                3 - Q

                4 - I

                4 - S

                4 - Q

                5 - H

                6 - L

                7 - S

                8 - E

                9 - S



        I tried to not make this too tough to reverse engineer.  For example,

one idea I toyed around with was to have the user enter a separate registration

number into each block, rather than just check it.  I decided that while this

was challenging enough to prevent most crackers from attempting it, it was not

a viable protection because your customers would get frustrated too quickly. I

invite others to also develop UNIQUE protections and share them with us.



Final Note:  As soon as a  correct answer has been posted to the +HCU

discussion, full source to the registration routine will be presented by me.

Please make any comments you want (i.e about my lousy windows coding). I'm sure

that there is at least one EASY way to crack this, however there are many ways

to get lost quickly.  Remember, a patch is acceptable, but the real answer is

a working code.
