War is a complex enterprise. In a sense it has many

revealings:

political, economical, psychological, demographical. I

will

present one possible vision of the true origin of the Kosovo war,

because it is

completely silenced in all mass media reports, though I

strongly

believe its importance is dominant.

<BR><BR>

I just multiply the "qui bono" ("who benefits")

principle to the

simple observation that most of modern (and past) wars

were

 wars for resources. Whenever you peek at a certain

"hot spot" at the modern world map be sure there's

something

economically profitable to wake someone's interest.<BR> 

Oil, advanced

geopolitical position, opium, diamonds, even Internet

auditorium :))

when seen as valuable resources are sufficient causes

to wage a war.<BR>

Next time I'll probably write an essay on war propaganda

patterns in

everyday advertising and marketing tricks :)) but now

let's get back

to those Balkans.

<BR><BR>

It would be tantamount to too much pride if really only one man (Milosevic) would 

be the

cause of all this, c'moff, that's just the typical hollywoodian "Boo-boo black hut" 

bad character, there are

certainly more solid causes. And one day I

found some

interesting information.

<BR><BR>

There are many ways to map a world. In my school days

I remember I saw

many types of world maps. Geographical, economical,

even political.<BR>

If we'll see a resource map of the world we may note

that Kosovo

region has 20% of the world chromite ore. From that

ore chromium is

produced. Chromium is a rather interesting metal. It is

classified as a 

"strategic resource" - for it is the main component

for stainless steel.<BR>

In fact it is used everywhere, alloy metallurgy,

military, electronics, 

automobile, chemical industry are obvious consumers.<BR>

Sure it is used in your 

Zepter frying pan as well - if you were unwise and surrended to

Zepter propaganda...<BR>

What is more interesting, there's a lot of chromium

ore (chromite) on 

Balkans and that chromite is cheap!

<BR><BR>

Here are some approximate numbers (dollars per ton)

for chromite

from largest world exporters:

<PRE>

South Africa                      $70

Kurdistan (Turkey)                $85

Kazakhstan (former USSR rep.)    $120

Central African                  $100

Albanian (and Kosovar!!!)         $65

</PRE>

(BTW, isn't turkish Kurdistan another hot-spot?

anti-Muslim 

repressions in Philippines? apartheid in RSA - there

you'll find rich

chromite fields)

<BR><BR>

Well, strategic resource is strategic resource. It

worths some

bombing. After all, somebody should cleanse somebody

else from

resource territory. Especially interesting in view of

all that

bloody Serbs that during the post-WWII period Albanian

population

on FORMER SERBIAN territory (Pristina is known to be

historical

old Serbian capital) exhibits steady increase - from

12% after

WWII to 51% in 1993! Who cleanse whom is a very very

slippery matter.

+Fravia was surely right to name both sides as war

criminals.

<BR><BR>

Applying old cherished "qui bono" principle we get

very interesting

picture. America doesn't need chromite from Balkans -

it has its own

supplies. But West Europe does. Especially in view of

future NATO 

rearming. After Albania (25% of world chromite

reserve, 20% of world 

trade) take a hold of Kosovo (20% reserve and 16%

export) it will 

produce about a half of world chromium! Sure its a

serious game.

(Historical excursus: during WWII Balkanic chromite

was controlled

by Italy, who jealously keep the monopoly even from

Germany)

<BR><BR>

Let's crack even deeper. I believe the true cause of

the war was

the crash of Soviet Empire. China and Russia invested

a lot

into Albanian and Yugoslavian chromium industries.

Balkanian 

chromium was exported both to socialism block and to

the NATO.

After collapse in Russia West decided that chromium is

to "reshared".

Back in 1995 there appeared a World Bank report

"Democratic Developement

Of Kosovo Region" (I'm lacking correct naming here :((

).<BR>

It admits the existence of reserves not only chromium

but also

lead, zinc, copper and other "sweeties" - and begs to

make all

these resources "more open" to Western investors. More

important,

Kosovo was never associated with Yugoslavia in the

report.

<BR><BR>

I am Russian so I can't go without some ramblings of

Russia 

involvement into the conflict. Especially as a

response to +fravia

request for some propaganda "from the other side" :))

It is not

interesting. All that "slavonic brotherhood" and

bla-bla-blas.<BR>

Of course "NATO aggression", "war criminal Clinton"

and "civil 

casualties" are common words. Lousy war.

<BR><BR>

Now it's time to get the true picture - after its collapse

Russia

is no autarchy (self-supplied country) anymore. It is

short on tin, 

lead, zirconium ..and chromium of course! Kazakhstan

chromite are now

extracted by ..Japan! Yugoslavian chromite was the

last  source relatively under russian control . 

<BR><BR>

<BR>

Final remarks. The information presented of course is

incomplete, 

incompetent, the author surely is not indifferent to

chromium. I 

must even confess half of my life I lived in Ural

region in a town 

where large chemical complex resides. Its main product

was ..sodium

bichromate - the base for chromium chemistry. And I

still remember

big unemployment of 1992-1993, and that main question:

"Where to get

chromite?" - was suspended in the air (as third of the

population

worked in complex). That is a past, though. Readers

are welcome

to build their own "Burning Chrome" vision. Read more,

check sources,

THINK. But the sad truth is the world will certainly

participate 

in more and more resource wars of any kind. We

reversers should 

be able to uncover true motifs, to read between the

lines (it's an 

old euphemism to describe reading on metalevel, not

exact words, 

but author's mind - "read between the lines - there's

no mistakes"). 

<BR><BR>

Life is too short to be victimized by propaganda.

Resist!
