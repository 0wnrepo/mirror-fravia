Cracking the Mystique Patch for Tombraider.



Date: 11 October 1997

Target: Matrox Mystique patch for tombraider.

Where: On the patches page at <A href="tppmsgs/msgs2.htm#237 tppabs=" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tppmsgs/msgs2.htm#237 tppabs=" http://www.matrox.com/mga"/">http://www.matrox.com/mga/</A>

Tools Used: 

Softice 3.2 (Get it! The video card support is 100 times better!)

Wdasm 8.9 (Find the registered version on the web!)

FileMonitor





Well, a friend of mine just got Tombraider on warez, but then needed 

the Matrox Mystique video patch cracking for his video card.

I thought this would be a perfect opportunity for me to try some 

DOS4GW cracking, and to see what a cd-rom protection was like.





First of all, I ran FileMon, whilst I ran Tombraider.

I noticed that it searched all drives(from a to z) for 

&quot;\data\title.phd&quot;, obviously a CD-file.

It couldn't find it, so I used subst

eg: subst j: d:\games\tomb



Now I ran it again, and it succesfully found title.phd on the faked j drive

Then the target tries creating a file in the root directory of the drive 

where it found the file on (in my case j:).



I then tried to use fakecd, but for some reason this program allows 

file writes (or atleast it did on my system...) so it did not behave like 

a read-only media (a CD-Rom) would have done...



Ok, I now had a theory about what to crack, but no idea about how to 

crack it (I have never cracked a DOS4GW program before).



I wasn't sure if Dos files could be disassembled using Wdasm, but I 

gave it a try and it seemed to work.

In the dead listing of tomb.exe, there are only 3 interrupt 21's that 

have ah=3d (open file)

I wrote down the op codes for these instructions, and then loaded 

tombraider once more.



When the initial DOS4GW screen appeared, I pressed ctrl D, and 

then did a search for the byte-codes of my three interrupts.



Once found, I then set a bpx on them, and let the program run once 

more.



Only one of them ever seems to be executed, and that is the one at 

82E1BAAD

Ok, So when it searches for its CD-file &quot;title.phd&quot; , this file must be 

found successfully, yet when it searches for the random file, this must 

NOT be found, and yet they both use the same code?

What's happening here?



Obviously the code at 82E1BAAD returns a value, and the value is 

checked further up the code tree.



So both times (when it expects a &quot;good&quot; open file, and when it 

expects a &quot;bad&quot; open file), I repeatedly press F12, to go back up the 

call tree, and wrote down the values as I went...



Good. Expects file to be opened successfully.

82E1BAAD, is called by

82E0FFFA, is called by

82E10079, is called by

82E1008E, is called by 

82DE35A4



Bad. Expects file to NOT be opened successfully

82E1BAAD, is called by

8EE0FFFA, is called by

82E10079, is called by

82E1008E, is called by

82DE3624



Ahh, we have found some code that differ!



The code at 82DE35A4 and the code at 82DE3624 

look like this...

<FONT color="blue">

call 82E1008E

test eax,eax

jz ....

</FONT>



Ok, this means that after each call, it checks for  eax=FALSE.

Eax will be = 0 when the file could NOT be created or opened 

successfully. 5which happens when you write on a CD-Rom, 

a very simple way to check if the media is a CD, btw).



We want to fool the program into thinking that the file was not 

created, like it would have happened on a &quot;REAL&quot; CD.



Thus we can just change 

7410	jz ...

to

EB10	jmp ...



But if we were to do that, every time we ran tombraider, we would 

have a new random &quot;checkCD&quot; file added by our target to the tomb 

directory, not very elegant...

Why?

Because we don't allow the program to delete the file afterwards!



Here is the code that checks for the valid file:



624: E85DCA0200	CALL 086	//Try to Open file

629: 85C0		TEST EAX,EAX	//File Opened successfully?

62B: 7410		JZ 63D		



//This is only called when cd-rom is &quot;writable&quot;

//This happens when eax=1



62D: E826CD0200	CALL 358	&lt;Maybe delete file?

632: 89D8		MOV EAX, EBX

634: E8CFD00200	CALL 708	&lt;Maybe close file handle?

639: 31C0		XOR EAX, EAX	&lt;Set bad flag

63B: EB05		JMP 642		&lt;Jump to end



//This is jumped to when the file could not be written to

//This happens when eax=0

63D: B801000000	MOV EAX, 1	&lt; Set &quot;good&quot; flag

642: 83C410		ADD ESP, 10

645: 5A			POP EDX

646: 5B			POP EBX

647: C3			RET



So, what do the calls at 62d and 634 do? Who cares? They are 

evidently used to clean up the file, so we may as well use them

ourselves.

The easiest way to change this is to nop out the jmp at 63b, so 

that it will fall through to 63D, and always set our good flag.



Therefore change

63B: EB05             JMP 642

to

63B: 31C0             XOR EAX, EAX   ;ax is zero! Who cares?

                                     ;will be set true in the

                                     ;next instruction!



And it works!

Is this all? I wasn't sure, but it anyway no longer said &quot;please 

insert tomb raider cd&quot; at the start of the program, and there 

wasn't any files left in the tomb directory either... clean 

crack!



I couldn't test it any further (I don't have a matrox video card 

myself), but when I took it round to my friends house it seemed 

to work. If I later find it doesn't or anything, I'll update this 

tutorial....
