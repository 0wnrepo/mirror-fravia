<CENTER><H2>Cracking cd1xedit.exe ver 1.23a:  "offline"

debugging and other little marvels

</H2><BR>By Svd, 9 January 1999<BR>Slightly edited by fravia+<HR><I>

An essay in the great reversers tradition... and a nice lesson for protectors as well... I like this essay, full of 

nice little tricks (like the creation of a small bin to disassemble just 

the part of the code you'r interested in... of course Svd is right... and  I suspect 

that 

we are all by now so used to our huge *.alf dead listings that we simply don't always 

remember that there's a special proud also 

in being EFFECTIVE without any waste :-(<BR>BTW: I'm using an old 

Texas Instrument calculator  for 

complex hexadecimal conversions as well (amazing how cheap are these little marvels 

once they 

are deemed 'obsolete' by the stupid commercial slaves)... way more effective than even 

the best software...</I>

<BR>Cracking cd1xedit.exe ver 1.23a<BR>method used: "offline"

debugging<BR>by: SvD<BR><BR>i cracked that proggy, at least removed the

annoyed nag start-screen.<BR>Of course, dealing the way i do, one can go

further and find what-ever<BR>else he wants. I'm not interested in 

the crack as a

crack, but in the<BR>method that I will call  "offline"

debugging.<BR>I will try to explain ut here, coz i've used

it for many years with success.<BR>This kind of cracking is very useful,

when you don't have proper tools AND<BR>the proggie is

not self-checking/protected/compressed... OR<BR>when you have all of them,

but they don't give any results :)<BR><BR>Tools i used:<BR><BR>* hiew.exe

5.15 - any hex editor + any disassembler will do;<BR>Hiew just

incorporates both of them and saves the<BR>annoing (copy bytes out, 

disassemble, view) procedure;<BR>* exehdr.exe 3.0  - exe dumper; '1992; use

/verbose option some;<BR>* some hex/dec calculator - i use my Sharp coz i

have no resident one'<BR>* BRAIN... nothing else<BR><BR>I have no SoftIce,

especialy for win; no ida; no wdasm. it will be nice<BR>to have these tools,

but i would have to find them, to crack them, and<BR>especially to LEARN 

how tyo use them... and i'm too lazy

now...<BR><BR>(if u want, read my other essay at 

<A href="bulg_1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulg_1.htm">fravia.org/bulg_1.htm</A> 

for<BR>Data

Reversing Techniques. They are useful here)<BR>As it was required, i'll

explain also how i guessed things right.<BR><BR>[the info i had up to now

was: the .exe is win16bit, with delphi<BR>(i.e.Pascal), and some IceLock

protection (i've never heard of it)<BR>But that info could be gathered

otherwise: 1) run the exehdr - it will<BR>tell you that it is win 3.10 prog;

2) Look at any string table:<BR>strings start with a byte of their size

(which means Pascal); 3) and<BR>the proggie itself says that it is not win32s

compatible, and author<BR>said may be soon will make it 32bit.]<BR><BR>copy

the cd1xedit.exe to have the original somewhere else,<BR>for example copy it

as file zzzzz. You may need both the original and<BR>the cracked

thing.<BR><BR>so, 1st I run the PC Magz InCtl3 to listen to the activities of

the<BR>proggie. then i run it (cd1xedit.exe). Play a little, then

close.<BR>InCtl3 said nothing added to registry, win.ini,

system.ini.<BR>Anyway, the program remembers somewhere the time

elapsed.<BR>and the Time is initially 15 hours.<BR><BR>And then i run again and

push Register button to see what happens.<BR>There is a window with some

name, password etc...<BR><BR>[now i will describe a wrong suggestion - if you

are bored skip it]<BR>**** bo wrong suggestion<BR>So, i made a mistake and

started to look for the strings there. I<BR>looked for the "password:" string

and i found it with hiew. But that<BR>was some resource-grouped-structure

withou code there... then i<BR>studied it carefully and saw two suspicios

strings: "ProgramKey1"<BR>and "ProgramKey2". Search for them,... he-he, there

they are used...<BR>0x3FE1A... and just before them is the IceLock signature,

some names<BR>as strings (possibly window fields) used.<BR>Now

disassemble.<BR>((HIEW can disassemble; if your editor can't, here

is<BR>another trick. Extract the piece of code that you are interested

in,<BR>for example, from ofs 0x3FD00 to 0x40000, write it to file

named<BR>somethng.BIN, then run Sourcer or any other disassembler

to<BR>disassemble it. A long time ago i did not have HIEW, and made

a<BR>little C program, extracting 1K parts from some .exe given a list<BR>of

offsets))<BR><BR>I watched there, changed some  XOR AX,AX  to  SUB AX,AX 

(both are 2<BR>bytes and zero the ax register) in order to see if the .exe

is<BR>protected-by-itself - no it was not. But i didn't continue with

that<BR>piece of code (there are 2-3 procedures), because changing some

other<BR>CMP's and JE to JMPS or NOP,NOP doesn't give any result different

than<BR>GENERAL PROTECTION.<BR>**** eo wrong suggestion<BR><BR>Then i thought

a little, and run the proggie again. Wait some time,<BR>close it. Run

again.... OK, i noticed that time is counted by minutes<BR>only.<BR>OK,

multiply 15 hours * 60 mins = 900 = 0x384. Search the .exe for<BR>bytes x84

x03. Here they are: ofs 0x178D1, in some MOV ...[], 0384;<BR>another 2 MOV's

a little after that, and a PUSH 0384 immediate. The<BR>rest occurences are

not interesting: in some strings, or offsets in<BR>other commands (I'M

WONDERING IF SOMEONE SOMETIME will figure out to<BR>count not a simple

number, but to alloc some big heap of bytes and<BR>count them, comparing

adresses, not numbers... ;-)<BR><BR>hmmm, let ignore whole procedure. just

find the ret, (it is RETF<BR>04 - 3 bytes) and type it into the start instead

of (PUSH BP  MOV<BR>BP,SP) pair.<BR>Run proggie. You see? "YOUR TIME HAS

EXPIRED", etc... Well, restore<BR>the bytes as they were.. We have found the

time-counter initialization<BR>routine.<BR><BR>[second possibly-wrong

suggestion: but gives a light over the next one]<BR>***<BR>hmm, let's change

the number in all the MOV's to some other, for<BR>example 0x444 (i.e x44 x04

as bytes). There are come CMP's and JE<BR>before every MOV. hmmm. they are

made to ignore the MOV's if<BR>something is zero... Let's make all of them

(3) go always through the<BR>MOV's.... Run the proggie... You see? "you have

14:59 left". Despites<BR>that 1 minute before it was 14:42 (for example - it

depends how much<BR>we played initially)<BR><BR>ok, now lets see what happens

if we change that immediate PUSH. make<BR>it, for example PUSH 0x584 instead

of 0x384. Run the proggie... "YOU<BR>HAVE 18:39 left". ha-ha. ok, now we can

make it as much as we want,<BR>but how to get that nag screen

out...<BR>***<BR><BR>NOW, the most useful part of this comes.<BR>you can use

this anywhere in any .exe<BR><BR>we are intersetd how to make that functin

disappear... Well, we will<BR>simmulate the run of the stack. Find where is

the function start:<BR>0x170E5. Now, look very carefuly at the EXEHDR

results: there are all<BR>segments listed on by one, with start offsets and

size + other<BR>features.<BR>0x170E5 is in segment 4 (starting at x14200), so

the offset of out<BR>func there is 0x2ee5. Now look after the segment table.

There are ALL<BR>the cross-references of all the CALL's in the .exe. Search

for 0x2EE5,<BR>segment 4. only once. offset 0x2A19, segment 9. Which means

(adding<BR>segment 9's start offset 0x38700) file offset 0x3B119 .  Now run

HIEW<BR>and go there. And disassemble. There are some CMP+JE's

somewhere<BR>below....there is CMP+JE's a little before it ....<BR>hmmm, if

you play with the jumps after it, you will get the "YOUR TIME<BR>HAS

EXPIRED". Let make the CMP+JE's that is before to alsays skip<BR>(i.e. change

JE to JMPS).<BR>Here we are. The nag screen disappears.<BR><BR>Now, if anyone

is interested, or the protection you have is more<BR>sophisticated, you can

follow the same method - find func's start,<BR>look in wchich code segment it

is in EXEHDR's results; find any<BR>references to it; explore

them...<BR><BR>have a nice dream.<BR>adio<BR>SvD<BR>P.S. for the lazy

one's:<BR>Comparing files CS1XEDIT.EXE and original<BR>000178C6: EB

7C<BR>000178D5: 44 84<BR>000178D6: 04 03<BR>000178E2: EB 7C<BR>000178F1: 44
