The multi-industrial conspiracy</H2>

by Cioff, 2 december 1998<BR>



</CENTER><BR>

Dear Fravia+



<P>You asked for it. Blame yourself. I told you before that I won't offer 

you paper quality to my essays. Most of them are suppressed; put into the 

deep of my hard disk and never let out again. I could find more examples, 

but I'm fed up. Besides, the examples I have given you, belong to the "serious" 

part of the industry. There are lots of cowboys. No end. But I know too 

little, and could not care less. 

<BR>&nbsp;

<H1>

The multi-industrial conspiracy - an essay by ?Cioff.</H1>

Very few seem to have understood how central and powerful the drug industry

is. It is striving for world domination in an even more pervasive manner

than the computing industry. The computers are a tool belonging to a certain

level of technical prowess and sophistication. The drug industry works

with the bare basics of human life, not as important as food, but close

to it. Swallowing a tablet or taking an injection requires no skill, only

the money to buy the product. And to the patient it appears as magic -

<FONT color=blue>impossible to crack; even worse to reverse</FONT>. This is all tolerable, even

OK.

<H3>

The cheats</H3>

But the industry is cheating, by professing that it works for health. Because

it doesn't. It works for profit. Huge profits from selling expensive products

with low production costs. I have written before of their marketing tricks.

<H3>

The real source of profit</H3>

They make their money from disease. If the amount of disease in a society

goes down, then down goes the need for drugs. A rich society without disease

is a market lost. If one disease disappears, it is time to invent new ones.

Isn't it a paradox that the per capita consumption of drugs increases drastically

in the affluent and healthy societies?



<P>If one treatment cures a disease and another maintains a comfortable

life without a cure, the industry will go for the one with the chronic

treatment.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>

Food-related drugs</H3>

If you eat too much and drink too much Belgian beer, and drive a car instead

of bicycling, and watch TV with a snack or cake every evening, then it's

easy to get fat. The junk food business (including the breweries - maybe

not the Belgian ones?) tries to help you as much as possible. This causes

a lot of problems. The health prophets everywhere preaches doomsday for

us because of this. Premature death, from complications of



<P>high blood pressure

<BR>high blood cholesterol

<BR>diabetes



<P>So there will be strokes, coronaries, impotence, depression.

<BR>It is a fact that these problems would go away if the eating habits

were changed. But the pharmaceutics industry comes to rescue, offering

drugs against those problems, so there is no need to do anything drastic

about the product spectrum of the food industry, or the TV commercials

for all that junk.



<P>Exercise decreases blood pressure. So do the pills. The State or the

Insurance companies pay for the pills, <FONT color=blue>but not for the exercise programs</FONT>.

You may guess where the money comes from



<P>The earliest blood pressure lowering drugs (those that might have saved

Roosevelt and averted some of the disasters following the Yalta conference)

were of a sort that maybe prolonged life, but definitely made life seem

longer. The decades after brought about lots of different classes of blood

pressure lowering drugs. The best ones came, I think, in the fifties or

sixties (the thiazide diuretics). They are now ridiculously cheap compared

to their value, and have passed out of use. The industry now says these

drugs are metabolic poisons. But they aren't. Much of the problems were

caused by too high doses. If I had needed blood pressure lowering and needed

only one drug, I could have treated myself for the equivalent of a few

Euros per year - less than an annual packet of cigarettes <FONT color=blue>but the actual

product was taken off the market because of low profitability</FONT>. A typical

treatment would now be from 400 Euro and upwards (for example Cozaar, a

new drug). Combinations with other drugs may be necessary, like Adalat

Oros (300 Euro per year). Starting with the old ones: Esidrex one-half

tablet daily: 20 Euro per year. Combination with generic atenolol 50 mg

per day (one-half 100 mg tablet): 40 Euro per year. These are the prices

of a intermediately-priced European country. On the world marked the price

differences are much larger. So ten or more people on the old drugs could

be treated for the price of one on the newer ones. The atenolol, by the

way, would slow me down on the bicycle. Anyway, you may see the point.

Anyway: <FONT color=blue>The State pays, and more willingly the more expensive the drug

is</FONT>. And - a rhethorical question: Who decides which drug the patient is

going to use? I've answered that one before, I think.



<P>Cholesterol-lowering drugs decreases the mortality rate of people who

have had a coronary thrombosis. But it does not stop people from dying.

At a price of 900 Euro per year you can have Zocor and have your prognosis

improved somewhat.



<P>The State will also pay for your antidiabetic drugs - insulin, for example.

You can have 5x500 units for 50 Euro, or 5x300 units for insulin pens for

35. The State pays. The insulin will have to be injected. All the big insulin

companies are now developing insulin that can be inhaled (you breathe a

powder). This will make insulin acceptable to more and more people, so

you will need less and less diabetes to be eligible for insulin.



<P>Drugs against too much acid in the stomach is one of the big winners

on the drug market. You may know names such as Tagamet, Zantac, Prilosec

(or Losec). If you eat these drugs every day, your ulcer goes away. If

you stop with the drug, your ulcer comes back. But the most common cause

of too much acid in the stomach is a bacterial infection: <I>Helicobacter

pylori.</I> Kill all of them, and the ulcer goes away. Permanently. Without

any more drug treatment. <FONT color=blue>This information the industry has been suppressing

for years</FONT>. And when it could not be suppressed any more, they started spreading

the propaganda that treating the patients would cause so much antibiotic

resistance in the environment.



<P>So they make the medical community advocate Losec at 1700 Euro per year

instead of a simple triple therapy with cheap drugs - perhaps 50 Euro for

a single and definite treatment.



<P>Antidepressants are hugely popular. Did I hear it: No side effects,

high efficacy? You have all heard of Prozac. Or Zoloft. Or Seroxate.

<BR>But in the trials, the depression lifted in 70-80 percent of the patients

taking the drug, and 60-70 percent in those who received placebo (inactive

tablet - for comparison). This means that most of the ones treated did

not need the drug at all.

<BR>Another bit of beef is that quite a few of the users have troubles

if they try to stop using the drug. They have gotten into some sort of

dependence. So it's easier not to stop.



<P>After the depression success - on comes documentation that the drug

works for "social phobia". So if I am going to a meeting or a party and

don't feel quite good about it: Guess what? You go to the doctor, don't

you? And have a State-subsidised prescription for an antidepressant.



<P>And asthma. Some cases - perhapt the majority - are chronic infections

(Chlamydia pneumoniae) that may be cured. But the standard (and only well-documented)

treatment is long-term suppression of the symptoms. Becotide. Pulmicort.

Flutide. And a host of others which actually inhibits the clearing of the

infection. The State pays.

<H3>

Bone fragility</H3>

(osteoporosis) is a problem in older women in Northern Europe and the US

of A. Merck, Sharp and Dohme, Novartis, Procter&amp;Gamble are pushing

products against that: Fosamax, Miacalcic, Didronate. But it is all nutritional.

The doctors say: Calcium and vitamin D. But it isn't very effective. This

is why the drugs are so successful.<FONT color=blue>I say: Who suppresses the research

about vitamin K?</FONT>

<P>

You say: "Cioff's mad! Com'off these kiddish 'conspiracy' tehories!" 

<P>

But I say: Go into Medline

<P>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/htbin-post/Entrez/query?db=m_r



<P>or through the Altavista (I've cut through some spam for you)



<P>http://www.geocities.com/HotSprings/5633/gissenvitk.html



<P>for Vitamin K or phylloquinone and bone or whatever you like. Fractures,

for instance.



<P>Green vegetables (boiled cabbage or other GREEN vegetables or some soybean

or rapeseed or olive oil a few times a week would probably be enough).

Or fresh boiled potatoes instead of all the junk products made by industry

from potatoes (or grain, as pasta, for that matter).



<P>The drug industry even eats itself into the tobacco industry. An increasing

product group is the replacement therapy. Nicotine gums, nicotine patches.

And drugs; the Americans will know Zyban. The tobacco industry recruits

the users. The drug industry gets the maintenance therapy (because the

smoking cessation success and weaning off nicotine replacement therapy

is no more than 20 percent). 3 Euro for a nicotine patch?

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>

Male hair loss</H3>

Regaine is a product documented to facilitate hair regrowth on top of the

head. After 4-8 months you should ba able to see effect if there is some.

400 Euro per year is the cost. If you are lucky, you have some more woolen

hairs inthe area where you have put the drug. But none of the long hairs

you have lost and want back.



<P>Propecia is another one, with different properties. If you have 800

hairs somewhere on your head, Propecia will give you 100 extra. I say:

Give me 1000 hairs where I used to have 1000 but now have none.



<P>But no such drug existe.

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>

Oestrogen replacement therapy</H3>

One of the worries of this therapy that keeps the female skin low on wrinkles,

and the juices flowing even in old age, is the increased incidence of breast

cancers. Now it has been shown that 2 mg oestradiol per day (the standard

dose) is far more than necessary. One-sixth, perhaps, is enough. The cancer

risk increased with the oestradiol dose. But are the 2 mg tablets taken

off the market? I say: Sloppy science. Playing with lives. It is typical

that follow-up of participants in clinical trials are too short to make

a reliable assessment of the safety of the therapy. The low dose may be

safer. Nobody knows how safe. In the USA the market is penetrated by a

product called Premarin - Pregnant Mare Urine - is the raw material. I'd

rather drink stale beer.



<P>To conclude (and I've got blisters on my fingers now): The pharmaceutics

industry has made itself a market from the crimes of the food industry,

and suppression of the spread of knowledge or serious research about treatments

that do real prevention or real cure. Products are poorly documented and

studied. <FONT color=blue>Overbloated, overpriced, buggy</FONT>. Do I hear a bell ringing?



<P>Was this beef, Fravia+?
