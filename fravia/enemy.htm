 <BR>~<BR>

Enemy tracking, a very difficult art, can be divided into stalking, reversing language patterns and luring. In order to 

stalk you need a deep knowledge of Usenet spamming (and war) techniques like flaming, 

trolling and crossposting. A good reverser can moreover easily 'reconstruct' (part of) the 

snailtrail of his 

enemies and defeat their smoke curtains  

applying some easy semantical reverse engineering tricks. Finally the reverser will 

lure his targets into the open web and identify it.

Identity plays a key role on the web. In communication, 

which is the primary scope of any web-related activity, knowing the identity of those with

whom you communicate is essential for understanding and evaluating an 

interaction. Yet in the disembodied world of the virtual

community, identity is extremely ambiguous. Many of the basic 

cues about personality and social role we are accustomed to in the physical

world are absent. Other cues are presents yet difficult to interpret. If you receive email from 

a guy whose address Eric.Staunton@innocent.com with an attached image 

of a middle aged man sitting comfortably on the patio of his house, you may be fooled 

into thinking that you have to do with a guy named Eric Staunton. It could be, yet you'll 

never have any real proof of it. One can have, on the web, as many electronic

personas as one has time and energy to create (and memory to recall :-)<P>

Yet, while it is true that a single person can create multiple electronic identities that are

linked only by their common progenitor, that link, almost invisible in the virtual 

world, is of great significance. That is the weak point of any virtual created identity. It's easy 

to say that your avatars should have 'coherent' personalities , i.e. if you create a 'lorry driver' 

personality and a 'university professor' personality, the two should have COMPLETELY different 

speech patterns), yet this is very difficult to implement. Stalkers should be very versatile 

experts, ready to read and recognize voluntarily altered speech patterns.<P>Usenet, for obvious reason 

is the field you should peruse to learn the first elements of the stalking art. See: 

most of Usenet is meant to be non-fiction; the basic premise is that the users are who they 

claim to be. There are, however variances between the different newsgroups 

as to what constitutes a real or "legitimate" identity. And there are numerous cases of 

identity deception, from the pseudo-naive trolls to the name-switching spammers.<P>

Yes, there's a vocabulary you should 

learn:<FONT color=purple><PRE>a) Flaming: I.e. rude comments, insults, personal attacks, etc.

b) Trolling: I.e. fishing for flames. Usually takes the form of inane

postings like smarmy love chatter, useless pieces of boring

information, McClatchie's FAQ, etc.

c) Cascades: Endless meaningless threads the posters repeat the same

phrase over and over, sometimes with a little variation.  They are

amusing to the ones participating in them, boring to everyone else.</PRE></FONT><P><FONT size=+1>Boring 

as most of these little silly wars are, there are GREAT lessons in stalking hidden in there (as 

you'll see if you follow the links below). That's why you too will 

have to deal with this. Actually, as usual in the Web, many of our techniques cross and merge reciprocally: 

anonymity techniques, how to search knowledge, reality reversing tricks, usenet techniques, 

anti-spamming knowledge are ALL required to tackle some of the tasks that you'll have 

to perform if you really intend to master what you are trying to learn now. Let's, moreover not 

forget how useful will be our holy <FONT color=blue>software reversing</FONT> skills each time we'll decide to 

use some of the <U>many tools</U> that the Web offers to track down our targets (tools that are 

unfortunately at times crippled or simply too short-lived :-)

<BR>

I would say that if you are an experienced 'global' reverser you'll have more survival 

chances that many others, but only your own complementary work, and your own experience, 

will keep <U>you 

as a hunter</U> and <U>your target as a game</U> and not the other way round... since, for instance 

some of the professional spammers may turn quite nasty AGAINST you if you're not careful -and powerful- enough.<BR>

In order to gather more material, just search for 'avoiding flaming' and 'trolls flames' on 

Altavista or follow some of the links below... as you'll see 

there are all sort of documents and faqs on these subjects.  

'Trolling for newbies' comes from 'trolling': a style of fishing 

in which one trails bait through a likely spot hoping for a byte. Real well-constructed 

trolls have a double audience: 

the idiots (newbies and flamers) that byte the bait and 

the 'trolls-savy' that enjoy the troll.  I'll try to teach you also how to 

identify and track down experienced trollers, among the most interesting game out 

there (together with 

professional spammers on rogue ISP) for any 'professional' stalker... but let's go on with the 

basic knowledges...<BR><BR></FONT>

So, as we were saying, the basic premise is actually, often enough, that the users are NOT who they 

claim to be... the danger is that the 

limited identity cues may make people accept at face value 

a writer's claims of

credibility: it may take a long time - and a history of dubious postings - until 

people start to wonder about the actual knowledge on a

self-proclaimed expert. This said it is also true that - for web related 

matters - 'official' experts are often FAR inferior to clever autodidacts, so you never 

know.<P>Erving Goffman, in his classic work 

"The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life" distinguished between the 

'expressions given' and the

'expressions given off'. The former are the deliberately stated 

messages indicating how the one wishes to be perceived; the latter are

the much more subtle - and sometimes unintentional - messages 

communicated via action and nuance. Both forms of

expression are subject to deliberate manipulation, but the 'expression given off'' 

may be much harder to control. One can write 'I am

female', but sustaining a voice and reactions that are 

convincingly a woman's may prove to be quite difficult for a man.<P>

Writing style can identify the author of an posting. A known and notorious net personality hoping to appear online under a fresh name

may have an easier time disguising his or her header ID than the identity revealed in the text. The introduction to the cypherpunks

newsgroup includes this warning:<FONT color=purple><PRE>

The cypherpunks list has its very own net.loon, a fellow named L. Detweiler. 

The history is too long for here, but he thinks that cypherpunks are evil 

incarnate. If you see a densely worded rant featuring characteristic words 

such as ``medusa'', ``pseudospoofing'', ``treachery'', ``poison'', or ``black lies'', 

it's probably him, no matter what the From: line says. 

							- Cypherpunks mailing list</PRE></FONT>In 

this case, where the usual assessment signal - the name in the header - is believed to be false, language is used as a more reliable

signal of individual identity. See also <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.wetware.com/mlegare/kotm/html/knov95.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.wetware.com/mlegare/kotm/html/knov95.html'" tppabs="http://www.wetware.com/mlegare/kotm/html/knov95.html">an example</A> 

of a spammer using multiple identities on the very nice "Kook of the Month!" site.<P>

One newsgroup that contains many business-card signatures is comp.security.unix. The discussion here

is about how to make unix systems secure - and about known system flaws. Many of the

participants are system administrators of major institutions, others are just learning 

how to set up a

system in a fledgling company and some, of course, are hoping to learn how to break 

into systems :-).

A posting suggesting

that administrators improve their sites by changing this or that line of code in 

the system software could

be a furtive attempt get novice administrators to introduce security 

holes. Identity deception is a big concern of the participants in

this group, and this makes it VERY interesting for any advanced studiosus of these 

matters, to try  soon or later his luring abilities in this group. (When you'll do 

it, if you want to be taken seriously (and you'll probably don't go very far even so :-) 

first create 'really' your own company, say 'Software Alternative Limited', then name 

yourself 'Director of Software Development', create your domain 

and sign with something like "Director@SALSoft.com".<P>

Many varieties of identity deception can be found within the Usenet newsgroup. Some are quite harmful

to individuals or to the community; others are innocuous, benefitting the performer without injuring the

group. Some are clearly deceptions, meant to provide a false impression; others are more subtle identity

manipulations, similar to the adjustments in self-presentation we make in many real world situations.<P>

ntil recently, header information was quite reliable. Most people accessed Usenet with software that

inserted the account name automatically - one had to be quite knowledgeable to change the default data.

Today, many programs simply let the writer fill in the name and address to be used, making posting with a

false name and site is much easier. The astute observer may detect suspicious anomalies in the routing

data (the record of how the letter passed through the net) that can expose a posting from a falsified

location. Yet few people are likely to look that closely at a posting unless they have reason to be

suspicious about its provenance.<P>

It is useful to distinguish between pseudonymity and pure anonymity. In the 

virtual world, many degrees

of identification are possible. Full anonymity is one extreme of a continuum 

that runs from the totally

anonymous to the thoroughly named. A pseudonym, though it may be untraceable 

to a real-world person,

may have a well-established reputation in the virtual domain; a pseudonymous 

message may thus come

with a wealth of contextual information about the sender. A purely anonymous 

message, on the other

hand, stands alone.<P>

There are some useful tricks to narrow down the number of suspected targets in 

order to stalk a pseudonym user. One of the best ones I know of is the time trick, but 

in order to understand it you mist first know the elementary elements of an email header.

<B>Time pattern matters</B> (fravia's trick)<BR>

Now, all the above can be easily faked, what could be really important is that you may be able  

(unfortunately NOT always :-) to discern the TIMES of the day "patterns" when these operations have been 

performed that you can read above. See: if your target 

updates his web page, or mails letters to usenet, he will mostly 

tend to do it on a REGULAR basis. Even if 

he uses automated dynamic providers like Compuserve or AOL (which is always a good idea), 

and even if he writes to the usenet groups through an 

anonymous remailer, or DejaNew itself or whatever, he will tend to do it at FIXED TIMES. It is sometime incredibly 

easy to find out in which part of the world a target lives just studying his timing patterns!.<BR>

Most of the people work on Internet in the evening hours, say between 21 and 24:00 local time.<BR>

A common used 'luring' techniques consists in publishing or emailing to your target some 'luring baits' (in order to get the target to react) indicating a (faked and bogus) page of yours on some 

free server, where you have -supposedly- put something that 

the target badly needs or is interested into. Examining the loggings for that page 

you'll be able to see WHEN the target has accessed it. Many targets will access it 

anonymously just in case, yet few targets are careful enough to do that at an "abnormal" hour of the 

day.<HR>

<B>Deleted postings</B> (<A href="#balin">Balif</A>'s trick)<BR>

It may at times be useful to check which <U>cancel messages</U> have been sent to 

the newsgroups.<P>

  As Balif pointed out in a famous posting on alt.2600:  

to examine all <I>the cancel messages</I>, you can use Dejanews, which does

 not honor them but actually archives them. Do a power search on group

 alt.2600, for "control cancel", sorted by date. You can see there all cancel

 messages coming from a given address.

<P>

   Unfortunately Dejanews strips important headers. On your news server,

 cancel messages do not appear in the newsgroup, and are unseen to you.

 However you can view them by looking in the group "control.cancel". Beware,

 this group will most likely be enormous. It contains every cancel message

 your news server has received for all groups. Mine had 75,000 some messages.

 Here you can examine the headers of the cancel message. Yet it takes feeling and 

time to stalk information in this way.

<B>Sharp edges</B> (<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.sputum.com/sputools.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.sputum.com/sputools.html'" tppabs="http://www.sputum.com/sputools.html">SPUTUM</A>'s trick)<BR>

Say you have as your target your balooney@enemy.com; do Altavista and 

Dejanews searches for balooney@enemy.com looking for eventual postings where 

you may find his real name.  Especially check all various  alt.test.whatever 

groups,  as these may contain at least one instance of 'rough' preparatory 

postings, when the target fine-tuned her newsreader's configuration.

<P>

Do Altavista and Dejanews searches on any "sharp edge" that sticks out.<BR>"<FONT color=blue>Sharp 

edges</FONT>" are, 

according to SPUTUM "unique characteristics which can lead one to the real poster". 

Example:  balooney@enemy.com may use as Organization: "balooney inc." on all his 

Usenet posts. Maybe he forgot to remove this info when posting later. 

You search for "Organization: balooney inc." (as well as for posts 

containing his sig), and maybe find all his fatuous 

posts to alt.fetish.threelegs, and from thence 

you will find (if you'r lucky) his narcissistic website  chock full of juicy 

personal information (or at least of many more "sharp edges").

<P>

Other promising "sharp edges": trailing user name in path 

(...!news.foo.com!imamoron), funky newsreaders (ZippityDooDah News Alpha 

0.9), unique signature components.<BR>You may add signature patterns, and even particular 

emoticons like &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :-->  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; :*) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8-[<BR>Look hard. 

Be clever. Reverse your target.<P><FONT size=+2>

There is a whole section of mine, about sharp edges:<BR>read my 

<A href="lanpat.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/lanpat.htm">Language patterns and the stalking tablet</A> section.

</FONT><P>

3) What if the target used "X-No-Archive: yes" in her headers and all previous 

steps fail?  You may get lucky, and find <U>a follow-up</U> to a previous post 

which was posted without the "no-archive" clause.  Otherwise, the 

old fashioned 'heavy' way might work: go to the relevant Usenet newsgroup, sort the 

posters by author name, and look for your target "by hand".  Yes the task 

can be extremely tedious...which is why real stalking is for the patient hunter.

An interesting example: the &quot;Bokler guy&quot; identification

This is an old 'historical' example, yet it will quickly show you the power of Dejanew stalking: was one of the links on my 

old links.htm page: an &quot;enemy&quot; wich I described  

as &quot;worth investigating&quot;. In reality this guy is not an &quot;enemy&quot; of 

anybody (he only produces in visual basic 

 pretty simple encryption software) and his &quot;cracker page&quot; is not so bad at all, he use it 

 as &quot;scarecrow&quot; for the 

potential buyer of his software. Hope he will not grudge me if I use him as  an ideal subject 

for this lesson... anyway he makes money

 scaring people with our work, I'll scare him for free showing him what I 

know about him :-)<HR> Here is the original link to his

E-Mail Address: bockler_1@HIWAAY.NET

So is simply his HIWAAY provider, rerouting email. Telephon may also

be rerouted in the same way.<BR>

 Anyway if we use Infospace we get the address and

the real provider of the web space the other way round:<BR><FONT COLOR="#405040">

CompanyName:  Bokler Software Corp 

Address:      1570 Pacheco, Suite E-4

<I><CENTER>

There it is: the company is registered in Santa Fe, the provider is in Alabama. 

 Obviously such a small

 thing does not have a real server, and is hosted by somebody, in this case

 everything on the Bokler page comes through the &quot;hiwaay&quot; business spider, so we can now 

 definitely narrow in on and confirm New Mexico.<BR>

 Now we started with almost nothing and we found two names, two addresses, two private telephon

 numbers. Brocklehurst should be the

 real identity only if the &quot;James Moore&quot; name is just an Avatar (which I do not really

 believe given the &quot;Visualbasicality&quot; of these guys). &quot;Darren Brocklehurst&quot; is more probably a co-worker at Bokler

 or a good friend of James Moore and this is the guy we searched for... all in all a pretty good &quot;counter intelligence&quot;

Well, yes, Dejanew, as you'll learn on this very page is a very powerful stalking tool 

indeed, and the question "who hydes behind dejanew?" is therefore particularly legitime. (Watch it, part of the info needs to be updated:

You need a little background information about this: in the last couple of years 

alt.2600 (an old Usenet hacking group) has been heavily spammed by a guy known as 

'Archangel', that 

used some of the most know techniques: flaming, trolling, crossposting, faked avatars and 

gang emailing, in order 

to gain some dubious personal fame. Of course, in the eyes of 

any reverser worth is weight, Archangel's claims (on an Usenet group!) of 

having worked for the CIA and his 'attention seeking' activities 

did disqualify him immediately (no really competent person would ever 'seek 

attention' on Usenet), yet hundred 

of lusers and newbyes believed - and unfortunately still believe - the whole archangelology 

to be interesting stuff. (As Brian points out, it is relatively easy, on Usenet, to 

brag about things you do not know about). If you follow 

the link above you'll be able to read the results of Balif's stalking activity. Balif, 

a promising hacker, and an incredibly good stalker, 

has used intensively dejanews in order to reconstruct the 'history' of the spammer 

Archangel. Mind you: the whole Archangel saga is pretty boring (a typical case of 'flogging 

a dead horse' on usenet: taking topics that have been done to death and rehashing them), and 

DEFINITELY not worth investigating <I>per se</I> yet Balif's page deserves 

your visit if you want to learn how to perform a thorough stalking work.</I>

For a reverser, stalking can as much great fun as reversing software protections.<P>Next time you receive some 

spamming email DO NOT throw it away. Be cool, and try some of the tricks/techniques described 

above to stalk the spammer. If you have time you may even try the 'go for it' 

trick: most spammers, 

even among the most capable forging dudes, are infact trying to SELL you something, 

aren't they? There dwells the real 

weak point of these assholes. Somewhere, at a given moment  

they <U>have to give you</U> either a real address or a real telephone 

number or whatever in order for you to send them your money.<P>

Fishing spammers can be real fun therefore, especially if you have time, patience, flair and a 

little 

dose of social engineering capabilities.<P>

Once you have them you can administer your favoured punishment, from denouncing them to their 

upstream ISPs supplying service (not always useful) to slowbomb them (until they 

change real address) with 

 faked clients requests and bogus orders for whatever product 

they sell (very funny and frustrating for 

them). This is also IMHO the best method to deal with pyramid schemes: just let a dozen 

postmaster@[127.0.0.1] or whatever enter the scheme eh eh.<P>

A word of advice: don't choose too dangerous gamebirds at the beginning: real nasty people can 

be quite dangerous on the net. It is one thing to stalk a peaceful experienced troller, it is a completely 

different thing to stalk a ring of high-level protected commercial paedophiles. Learn 

your stalking, luring and logical reversing 

ABCs first and don't go around shooting yourself in your feet.
