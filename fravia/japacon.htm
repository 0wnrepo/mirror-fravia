A short introduction</H3></CENTER></CENTER><BR>

As most readers of our <A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">Reality cracking</A> section know, 

many essays there are directed against advertisement and our 'consumistic' habits. 

<BR>

Simply stated, there's a lot of money being made and a lot of power being gathered 

by the people that promote useless consumerism, and this determines a GREAT 

part of the reality we live in. We pay for it in gradually limited 

economic mobility, pollution, threats to our health and a declining 

standard of living, as measured by the things that really matter.<BR>

<BR>

Now, see what I found for you: you'll read below a delightfully intriguing little 

piece of reality... this has been published TODAY (6 October 1998) on the financial times...

<BR>

I really don't need to add much... after all you are supposed 

to be reversers, therefore enjoy! (and reverse!)

Hey, this is not taken from the Economist, but from the "Financial times" (on line edition).

Japan's antidote to depression ~ 6 October 1998



By Paul Abrahams in Tokyo



	Milton Friedman would be amused. The Nobel prize

winning economist, who once joked that the fastest way to boost money

supply was to throw dollar bills out of helicopters, may soon see a

variant of this idea put to the test.



The Japanese government said yesterday it was considering plans to

hand out Ä30,000 (£130) gift vouchers to every one of the country's

125m inhabitants.



The government is also considering a "Happy Monday" scheme, which

would turn an increasing number of Mondays into holidays in a bid to

persuade consumers to go shopping instead of going to work.



These are desperate times in Tokyo, as the government seeks to head

off what some economists believe is an imminent depression.



Yesterday, the Nikkei average of 225 leading shares fell another 2 per

cent to 12,948, its lowest since January 1986. Today, the government

is set to cut its forecast for gross domestic product this financial

year to minus 1.8 per cent. A few months ago, it was predicting 1.9

per cent growth.



The economics of the gift voucher scheme are perhaps a little more

rational than those of Friedman's free dollar bills. Like more

orthodox methods of stimulating an economy, such as printing money or

cutting taxes, recipients of the dollar bills could choose to save the

benefit rather than spend it immediately. But because the vouchers

would have a limited shelf life, people would have to spend them

quickly, giving a fast, if ultimately illusory, boost to the economy...</PRE>

And here another article on this same matter:

A yen for spending ~ 6 October 1998



In most places handing out wads of crisp new notes is a fine way to

get things moving. But not in Japan. The government there is so

desperate to revive the economy that it is looking for a way to force

people to spend the cash as well. Its latest idea is to give Y30,000

($223) gift vouchers to all Japanese inhabitants, with an expiry date

by which they must be spent. The plan sounds bizarre, but does have a

certain logic.



None of the Japanese government's measures for fiscal reflation is

working. Its plans for a massive infrastructure boost are being

thwarted by an unenthusiastic response from local governments, which

are already over-indebted. And in a country where infrastructure is

already well-developed, any new spending that does happen may boost

demand, but will do little to improve the economy's long-term growth

potential.



The tax cuts being introduced, meanwhile, will probably end up in

people's bank accounts (or, more likely, under their mattresses),

rather than being spent. The reasons are not hard to understand.

Prices in Japan are stable or falling, so that little is lost by

deferring consumption. Job insecurity is growing. And individuals

approaching retirement are increasingly concerned about the shaky

state of the life assurance industry.



Faced with these constraints, handing out money which people are

forced to spend straight away could be the only way to achieve a quick

fiscal boost.



The policy may prove administratively impossible. But even if it could

be done, it would fall well short of a panacea. The main effect would

probably be to change the timing of consumption, as people brought

forward their spending plans. After the vouchers were used up,

spending could quickly fall back.



And the scheme is too small to counteract the deflationary forces in

the Japanese economy. It might produce a boost of 0.7 per cent of

gross domestic product. But the International Monetary Fund estimates

that the Japanese economy is now running at about 8 per cent of GDP

below full capacity. The painful process of bank restructuring, if it

ever gets going, can only make matters worse in the short term.



The voucher idea is not crazy, and could help provide a much-needed

short-term stimulus to a rapidly deteriorating economy. But it needs

to be part of a much more substantial macroeconomics policy, including

large-scale monetary expansion by the Bank of Japan. And for the

economy to return to a reasonable long-term growth path, there is no

alternative but for Japan's politicians to tackle the structural

reforms that the country needs.</PRE>

So, the consequence, as I see it, is that we are entering a funny 

(if scary) future of 

'obligatory' consumerism. Instead of trying to find an exit from 

an economic crisis that is evidently INHERENT to the way the 

society works through a long overdue <U>re-thinking</U> of this same society and 

its basis and aims, we are hurrying towards the absolute Paradox: 

"<FONT color=blue>People don't want to buy crap? My Godness, we are doomed! Let's find out 

methods to compel them to buy said crap</FONT>".<BR>The rationale behind all this being 

apparently that the overall gains by the industry (from subsidies, 

political control through lobbies, overpriced products, workers firing and so on) are of 

such enormous amplitude that giving 

people free vouchers to buy their products will nevertheless increase these overall gains 

even more (unless you'r na‘v enough to believe they or their political puppies would really give out 

money for free :-)<BR>Therefore the really scary question is: <U>what they will come out 

next?</U> (once 

this pathetical schema too will have failed):<BR><B>Compulsory presence in the mall for at least 

two family members from 8:30 to 10:30?<BR> 

Tax reductions for heavy consumerists ("Stakhanovian" buyers in parade)?<BR> 

Compulsory attendance of TV-advertisement for kids and adults?<BR>

Salary paid in time-limited vouchers (so that people HAVE TO spend it)?

<BR><BR></B>

And, pray, why are these (allegedly) "free" vouchers not rather given to some of the 

undernourished 

people in the 

third world? Wouldn't you think that the 4/5 of almost-starving poors would better know what to 

do with it than the 1/5 of consumistic drilled citiziens of the 'affluent' societies?

<BR>The answer is quite simple: 

the 'poors' won't get it <U>because</U> it is not a matter of spending, it is 

a matter of WASTING.<BR>In fact the 'poors' would spend the same 

amount of 

money, yet they would (unless they have 

been massively brain-washed)  spend it <U>on more essential things</U>, and 

not on useless products and gadgets.<BR>

Apparently we are already so deep buried inside this "stupidity production cave" 

that  the powers that be can solely come out with an artificial boost of useless consumerism 

as only solution to their own-made manifest crisis.

 Ah! Ah! Poor old Karl will get quite some itches in his Londoner grave: He who laughs last laugh best! (Yet 

there's not much to laugh, come to think of it :-(
