Benzedrin's contribution</H3></CENTER>

<HR>

dear +fravia,

<BR><BR>

first to say that this is the first time I'm writing such a mail as

reaction

on visiting a webside.

I'm something like a quiet visitor and enjoyer of sides like yours,

neither a

hacker/cracker or programmer at all. Perhaps I'd like to be but I'm not

the

kind of man doing such abstract things. It's not my way. I love

computers and

would like to use them more the way I wish to, so I try to get

information

about it where it's possible. <BR>

About half a year ago I came to your side and was so impressed I

immediatly

downloaded a lot (sorry for that if you mind...) to be able to read it

offline

because so much information I never got to was to large to pick up

instantly. <BR>

I read all I downloaded, I tried to understand it which isn't that easy

- I'm

not English and not used to your terminology- but I'll keep trying

because

this is the most precious thing I found in the web yet. Now that I have 

studied a

lot of your site I realize why the web can be so powerful and new. 

<BR><BR>

But it's not only the information, it's also your attitude,opinion and

thoughts I'm profiting of. For weeks I wanted to thank you for that and

wanted

to encourage you going on like this, to continue what you started years

ago

together with your +crackers. Now that I've read your september news I

got

offended. I am something like a newbe and have no chance in

co-operating but

receiving what masters as you or +gthorne and all others offer me. In my

opinion masters have a obligation to teach not only the elite. These

should be

able to do it yourself. But what's their knowledge worth if it's not

shared

and spread? I think it will die out or wither in a secret circle.

<BR><BR>

Well, I'm not against a change, for example sometimes I find it hard to

get

back to lets say an essay I want to read again which is lost deep down

in your

sides, but who if not you teaches me about javascripts, what an M$

Internet

Explorer does when I'm surfing, who gives me a sealight-searchmachine

where

can I read such a funny article like IH8U's about Bypassing Win98's

Serial

Check and so on. I think there are lots of people like me who come to

your

page to get such information not only to search for cracks of games or

progs

or things like that. 

<BR><BR>

In hope you don't mind me telling you this, I hope you understand what I

trying to tell you. I would be sad being shut out as a non-reverser and

loosing what we call "esprit" as you offer.

<BR><BR>

I just read Freeman's mail and his words about the child and the

athlete.

Maybe you're disappointed or bored but isn't it very satisfying if you

succed

at least with one child?

<BR><BR>

No matter what your decision might be



i love to come back

my answer to Benzedrin (and others)</H3></CENTER>

<HR width=33%>

Ah, the old problem!

<BR><BR>

How díyou find information? Thatís the first question. What díyou do with the info you have found? Thatís the second one.

<BR><BR>

See, Benzedrin, I'm not fed up with people like you, 

Iím fed up with people that donít want to give, because Iím fed up with 

people that donít want to LEARN. See, one of the things I have learned (and that 

I wish all readers of my site will learn in due time) is that you should always 

WORK on the info you find, and then you should give at least a little part 

of this work as ëfeedbackí, as stimulus to the development of the material 

you did read. Thatís the real spirit of the web of ëoldí.

<BR><BR>

Now, see you donít need to be a ëtop elite insiderí to give a little. Why do you 

say that you "<FONT color=purple>have no chance in co-operating</FONT>"? In 

fact there are MANY helpful things you could do, if you wanted. Letís 

imagine youír really interested in an advanced section of mine (this one 

does not exist, itís just an example), let's say...  

"advanced section on code flow charting analysers" and flow analysing 

techniques.

<BR><BR>

So you plod through my basic ëflow analysingí section and then read "please 

understand: to access the advanced section you should contribute somehow". 

Oh my! Restricted information! How awful! Fravia+, you bloody Anti+ORC!

<BR><BR>

Now, would it really be so difficult to gather a lot of information on code 

flowcharting, and, say, put together a small essay about the existing tools? 

Or, say, prepare a small page of links to what you have already found that is 

not listed in my basic section? Or, say, criticise the text you found on my 

basic section on this and that points you donít agree with? Or, say,  point 

out some interesting connections that have not been seen yet? And so on, and 

so on... díyou get the picture? There are MANY forms of contributing that 

require a little (a little!) work on your part and that are so easy to 

accomplice I could shriek... when I see how few actually care to give 

something (something, just something!) back. I'm not speaking of you, Benzedrin, 

(although I cannot remember you did contribute until now :-) I'm speaking of 

those that 

instead of contributing, instead of working just a little to show that they 

care for what they are doing, that they 

have learned that the net is based upon mutual help, instead of giving 

something, even small crumbs... instead of that I keep 

finding a lotta readers ready to defend their holy right to leech 

whatever they want, even that what is meant only for real students... 

ah, those readers donít seem to know the ABC of information...

<BR><BR>

Should I open my advanced site-busting pages to all teenagers that 

just want to brag around? Díyou really want the spammers to know how to 

defeat every anti-spamming defense? Should any idiot be capable of nuking 

his neighbourís email address just because he does not like the way he 

looks/smells/speaks? We are speaking of (in part) real information here, 

and real information is <U>powerful</U> (yeah, I know this sounds stupid, yet 

it is damn true :-(<BR>

Therefore real information deserves <U>your own work</U>, your attempt in 

developing 

yourself... c'mon, at least a little. Besides myy site is already 

quite dangerous as it 

is, as anyone can see and many testify... and I think Iíll soon shut down most of it 

anyway.

<BR><BR>

See, readers, the ABC of information is that information 

is NOT free. It must be found, it must be reversed, it must be 

passed to others... all this requires work and understanding. $

Either you are capable to work and give, either you understand the 

VALUE of the (free) information you can gather on this site (and 

some other sites, I'm -thanks godzilla- not the only one), or 

you do not, and you just want to exploit pre-chewed info that others 

have gathered without your contribution and without your help.

<BR><BR>

If that is the case (and I hope not), then, only for those readers... get lost.

<BR><BR>

Fravia+
