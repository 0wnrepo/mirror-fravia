Hello +F,

<P>

I've finished reading the contributions in your septem.htm page just

now...

Well, what can I say? As you already know, I completely agree your

decision



of changing the site, and I'm sure that what you will do will be (as

usual)

simply great. Anyway, after all these contributions, I've started to

think

to some other things that didn't came up to my mind when I wrote you the

first time...

<P>

First of all, the "banal" essays. Of course, your site doesn't need

them:

there is really too much information yet for anyone willing to learn,

and

other material of this kind would be not only unuseful, but somehow 

dangerous for the student who just wants to learn a technique and finds

20

essays from which he can just view some examples, and no theory. 

Unfortunately, this is exactly what's happening in my university too: 

anybody can do an exam after he's done one thousand exercise, because 

statistically the ones he will find in the exam will be nearly the same 

he's done yet. BUT, if he finds a completely new exercise, HE CANNOT

SOLVE

IT! This is NOT reverse engineering, this is just a memory game!!! (For

this reason, I'm writing the essay "reverse engineering university

exams"

I talked you about and I hope it'll be ready soon!).

I said that the same thing is happening in my university, because what

we

have here is a bunch of students who think that master +ORC's tutorial

are

old, and ask for essays about just released programs. REAL knowledge

won't 

EVER be old! In +his tutes the techniques are explained in detail, so

that 

when you find a protection you immediately understand what kind of

protection 

it is. The code isn't really important, and all the newbies who want to 

learn to crack should know that +HCU students did it reading tutes

about 

programs they maybe didn't even crack... I personally cracked just ONE

of 

them, and it was the one I had to crack to pass the strainer. Instead,

more



and more people ask new tutes about new programs (even if the

protection 

is always of the same kind!) because they don't really want to learn to

crack,

but they just want to deprotect THAT particular program, and THIS is not

good.

Please don't blame me. I'm not against newbies (I'm trying to make my

page

as much "newbie-friendly" as I can, and I'd be happy, as I told you +F,

to

continue publishing essays for newbies since you've decided to stop).<BR>

But I

would like to see NOT the crack, but the TECHNIQUE explained: the way

the

user intercepts the right call, the way he uses his tools, the order he 

uses them, the new tools he's written, and so on... only this way others

will be able to apply the things they have learned on other proggies.

After that, it's not important, IMO, if the target is a program to

crack,

a tool to ameliorate or a secret feature explained, because everybody

will

be able to crack other programs, ameliorate other tools and find new

secret

features if he's really learned the technique used. And, for the same

reason,

the program itself won't be important.<BR>

Said this, I don't think +you have to remove the old essays. They'll be

a good reference anyway for the ones who, once learned the basic

techniques,

will want to try some "exercises". But they should remember this thing:

reverse engineering is, after all, a _deductive_ process (it's called

"inference" too): it starts from particular events and try to formulate

general rules. So they should do with this material, trying to obtain

general rules to follow to reverse engineer EVERY program they will find

in the future.

<P>

For what concerns the other labs, I agree to your choices, with the hope

that it will be possible to add new others in a second time (+gthorne's

and +mammon's ideas are simply great imo!).

<P>

Finally, I'd like to thank all the +guys that wrote their contributions,

because it's only thanks to them that I started to think about this

email

of mine... so it's their fault if you don't like it! ;)

<P>

*PHEW!* This was long... I hope I haven't bored you with my words, but I

thought they could have been useful for someone. I've personally started

to write more theorical essays and I'll publish them asap (of course, as

always, you'll be the first to know it!).

<P>
