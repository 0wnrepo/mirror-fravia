Dear +Fravia:

<BR><BR>

Sorry, I¥m too late to reply. Anyway...

<BR><BR>

Don¥t you feel something is missing? You say: "is a

mistake to lean too much on their

petty, selfish interest.", man, can¥t you see that

pirates and bootleggers aren¥t 

interested in learn nothing at all?! They seeks for

profits only.

<BR><BR>

I bind up myself to read carefully all the letters

you have received up to date, 

(including your reply to Benzedrin) and then apply 

reversing them: a) many people 

who state "OK, +Fravia, you are right, kick off all

the beginners¥ garbage" seems 

+crackers (see for instance frog¥s print: "I think

the +HCU has reached a point where 

there's no real way to make it more interesting or

even to improve it." . b) many ones 

who are a bit dissapointed with your decision, seems

to be beginners. c) all the people 

agree with the holy statement: "info wants to be

free" but add their selfish rules 

(either to limitate or to superenhance the freedom).

d) You feel yourself a bit void.  

You give a lot but don¥t crop nothing at all. We (the

readers-only) are a bunch of 

bloody wolves, vampires sucking blood from your

jugular.

<BR><BR>

The exception (don¥t fit into the reversed scheme):

DaVinci. He is very clear when 

state: "I guess my greatest concern is that you don't

do anything that would discourage 

the beginners." and "we were all beginners at  one

point" . (Goth, please, read carefully).

I quote just a few but agree his whole letter and

sincerely envy his sharpness and  

clearness.

<BR><BR>

See, Fravia: you cannot ask an elementary school

pupil to write a study about 

molecular biology. Inevitably must result in a crap,

no matter how so hard he works. 

I¥m just a beginner, I draw a lot of information from

your site. ThankU+. I read a lot 

from your an other sites. But, damn!, I¥m so moron

(It won¥t be long,  I hope :-) that 

cannot write a single  line without to appear a

ridiculous one. And then, should I pay 

you for the information? Give me the invoice, I ¥ll

try to help you as long as I can, 

but please, don¥t ask me today for a silly essay

(that you don¥t need, anyway).

<BR><BR>

Look, the problem -as you wrote- is: "grow or die".

But "grow" does not imply to get 

rid  of all the "crap" of to-day, that was 

diamonds just last

week... this iamounts more or less to the similar 

"upgrade and die" paradigma (like your PC, if you "upgrade"

it from W95 to W98 ;-) Can't you find the 

Zen way? Let the Ying and Yang stay together in your

site.

<BR><BR>

Watch, we (the newbies) can understand that an essay

like "cracking windows calculator" 

will be very boring for all +masters (see the pitty words

from Goth).   Can't you, and Goth, and all +masters, 

keep in mind that it¥s nevertheless essential for

newbies? A gigabyte is now cheap. 

All your readers would be happy -I'm sure- to give you a little

contribution for the sake of 

knowledge. Let your site <U>unchanged</U> for the beginners

and make a new one for those who 

deserve the honor to access all higher levels. If you do

so, we (beginners) can learn some 

basics and Frog¥s Print will not get bored to death. 

And give access to the new site 

only to the people you want (anyway it would not make much sense 

for newbies... figure you a

beginner dealing with ring-0 privileges,  

virtual memory handlers and  segmentation, LRU

algorithms... :-O)

<BR><BR>

Briefly, IMHO you should give to all +masters that who

belongs to +masters and the remainder should be given

to the beginners. Perhaps reducing all redundancies... If

you wish, I can help you  checking 

out the essays, although I¥m not sure to be the right

one. (Test me!).

<BR><BR>



<HR>

A word about me (should not matter at all)

<BR><BR>

I¥m neither Red nor Cracker (I hope to become ;-).

Just a newbie, but +Old. Protection schemes in software 

programs are my hobby (just like other people collects

post stamps or build little 

ships into bottles). It does not matter to me if 

the targets are

commercial or not. Although the money 

is a very rare stuff in my life,  I don't do it for money: I just

crack and reverse for pleasure.

<BR><BR>

I also read for the sake of knowledge (I guess you

teach us all for the same reason)<BR> 

See, I (like other million people) got access to the

Net some time ago -you should 

consider I¥m living in a far, poor, LatinAmerica

country :-( 

<BR><BR>

Finally, facing the risk to getting you mortaly bored

here is  my personal excuse for non contributing: I never sent 

any essay coz  I cannot give you a very nice one,

though I have improved a little. Some time 

ago (say 4 years ago, when I was fascinated by the 

computer virus subculture), I fancied 

to get a "mastership" by "discovering" the PIQ trick for

the 386 and I wrote a protection 

scheme for my own polymorph encrypter / decrypter

procedure -to be attached in the 

begining of a program  (right, I read about it in

your pages, I noticed also that the Pentium 

chip definitively shut down the PIQ trick :-(

<BR><BR>

Oh!, yes, I wrote my own tools too. For example, a 

DOS TSR that intercepts  file activity 

via INT21h, logging it in a text file... useful but 

quite out of date, wouldn't you think?

<BR><BR>

And, of course, I normally speak spanish, so my readers 

should forgive my syntax.

<BR><BR>

I sincerely appreciate your huge effort in support

reversing and cracking and protecting.

Have a grat new year, and be happy. All that what 

people do, should be done for the sake 

of happyness.

<BR><BR>
