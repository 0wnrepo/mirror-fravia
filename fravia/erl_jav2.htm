Lately, many of our more industrious and investigative interpreters have taken it upon themeselves to supply fravia's site with documents which purport to explain and/or illuminate the origin of a project which we believed to be a wholly unique reversing endeavour: namely, the production of the pages which you now casually finger.
Yet, to our horror, we discover that (alas) this section apparently has had some predecessors, a sobering fact to which the brief but informative squibs arranged above attest.
In light of this new discovery, the editors gently wish to make it known that they claim no 'squatter's rights' regarding this pre-ordained intellectual territory, but are interested only in the free dissemination of this kind of knowledge. 
Welcome to the new java section of mys ite, dear reders, scouting into java will be assured by my dogg Earl, maybe the only person I know of that can describe in writings an altavista search.

ed. Now, I don't know what you got out of these links.  Here's what caught my nose.

Java is a revolutionary idea, but it's caught up in real life problems... not so 
portable as it needs to be, not so universal as it could be - giant drayhorses 
pulling it in different directions.  And it's slooooow.  Turns out to be like 
medicine, one dose of one thing doesn't cure everything, and may make you woozy.

Secondly, everybody had to learn it in an instant.  All that effort spilled over 
onto the internet, where we can still hear it crackling.  

Here's a link to <a HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.almide.demon.co.uk/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.almide.demon.co.uk/'" tppabs="http://www.almide.demon.co.uk/">Java at Middlesex</a>.

Used?  Pragmatism winning over religion. What can derail java?  at 29, 30 JavaSoft 
loses control of Java? and Fatal flaw discovered in security model?

Third, for me, there's a lot more to learn... even simple games can have complex 
strategies, and unforeseen consequences.  Try the little game, <a HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/~chenyang/java/go.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/~chenyang/java/go.html'" tppabs="http://iacl.ece.jhu.edu/~chenyang/java/go.html">Baduk</a>.

The obvious place to go is to <a HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sullivan/Java2.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sullivan/Java2.html'" tppabs="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sullivan/Java2.html">Professor Sullivan's Learning Java Page</a>.  At &quot;Getting
Started With Java,&quot; he gives us a great introduction to what is at Sun Microsystems,
for instance: <a HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/'" tppabs="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">Sun: the Java Tutorial</a>.  

What I really want to read is <a HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://bruceeckel.com/javabook.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://bruceeckel.com/javabook.html'" tppabs="http://bruceeckel.com/javabook.html">Thinking in Java</a>, by Bruce Eckel.

But, I'm just a dogg!  And a new one, at that!  There are lots of significant things 
which escape my nose,  right on this page!  These are just the things I dragged into 
my backyard to chew on.  But oh, those trails.. the smells were great! 

We should bury all these links together in a Beagle's guide to Java: <a HREF="erl_jav3.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/erl_jav3.htm">library page</a>.

What's -Boojum sending me by email?  MORE links!  How am I ever going to chew down
all these bones, if he just keeps piling them up?
