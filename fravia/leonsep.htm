   		 As for the feedback on your up coming site changes, the general

                 consensus with my friends is that it would indeed be a sad day for

                 reverse engineering if you 

                 removed the essays from your site.  As a newcomer (6 months) to this

                 fine art - and like many, many reversers out there - your site was the

                 starting point.  Fravia's was 

                 the womb from which many of us were born, and we certainly will miss

                 browsing through its libraries of essays.  I understand your

                 frustration with the people who don't 

                 appreciate the art form and do it strictly for personal gain or

                 whatever, but the fact remains that this is human nature, and as long

                 as there are humans there will be 

                 plenty of lamers, losers, and idiots among us.  



                 I guess my greatest concern is that you don't do anything that would

                 discourage the beginners.  The one thing we all have in common is that

                 we were all beginners at 

                 one point, and it's imperative that we embrace these fledglings,

                 support them, and show them the way.   I agree with Prophecy in that

                 the tone of your writing on 

                 septem.htm was a bit demoralizing.  People are going to reverse

                 engineer for different reasons.  Some will improve the targets by

                 adding functionality, while others will 

                 simply defeat the protection for whatever reason.  It is a proven fact

                 in our governments that you cannot legislate morality by prohibiting

                 anything.  The right way is to 

                 change people's hearts by teaching them and by sharing knowledge, not

                 by closing them off to information.   



                 Your site is the lighthouse, the rule and guide so many ouse and

                 follow, and while a good house cleaning and update may be in order, it

                 would make the reverse 

                 engineering community extremely sad if you were to close off the part

                 that is important to so many of us.



                 Kind regards,

                 DaVinci</PRE>
