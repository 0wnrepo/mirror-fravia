<FONT size=+2>+HCU 1998: A real university<BR><BR>

by +ORC</FONT><BR>(29 October 1997)</CENTER><PRE>

Greetings, new and old friends, I owe you some explanations.

And I have some work for you.



   I'll tell you a (minor) secret: when I started publishing my tutorial

on Usenet, back in 1995, I did not know exactly where I would have landed.

My idea, to put it simply, was to take advantage of the might of Internet in

terms of anonymity, international dimension, easy access and "just in time" 

modifiability, in order to spread a very simple message using (as major vector) 

software cracking... this I deemed necessary coz verba movent, exempla trahunt.

   My message was threefold:

-	knowledge should from now on be free, we should not allow any barrier 

 	whatsoever any more;

-	everybody should not only be allowed, but also helped to develop his 

	capacities;

-	the consum oriented society wherein we are compelled to live is NOT 

	free, nor correct, nor the best possible one, far from it. We must 

	help others, blinded by a well-concerted propaganda, to realise this.

  If you examine these three sentences, you'll see that they support each other 

and that these same principle have been, many centuries ago, at the basis 

of the foundation of the "real" universities all over Europe.

  The word "university" is in itself a sort of synonym for "international 

dimension"... indeed knowledge does not care about national or physical frontiers, 

nor worries about different social systems, racial or gender differences.

  Language of course can (and did) represent a problem for the diffusion of 

knowledge (and more generally for the relations between humans), yet the english 

'pidgin' used to-day on the Web is a good (albeit emendable) solution. The fact 

that many among us are NOT English native speakers seems fortunately to represent 

a negligible problem nowadays. 

  Now, you see, in our to-day world knowledge is often (if wrongly) connected 

to software. Software importance is due to its paramount importance for all 

modern scientific disciplines. These are deemed important in order to create 

(and sell) the incredible amount of useless gadgets that let this society 

roll on towards its own well deserved doom. 

Note -incidentally- that 'humanistic' disciplines are nowadays reserved 

only to the <U>very</U> rich people, poor slaves are not supposed at all 

to study greek or latin, or poetry or philosophy... vita sine litteris mors 

est! Young 'university level' slaves are tricked into following scientific 

'trends' which may be useful for a short span, but whose short life will 

secure to the same gullible slaves an unemployed or under-employed miserable 

status later on. Or does anyone of you think that he could get teached in 

some other 'real world' university 'trend' courses that what he is 

learning here?.

  Anyway I felt that it was pretty important to use in this context the only 

scalpel I know of, since software and Internet are indeed a knowledge vector. 

This scalpel of mine is (you have guessed it :=) a cracking attitude.

  When I started the +HCU project, inside my "C" lessons, in April 1996, I 

basically wanted to find some help: i.e. someone else capable of disclosing 

our art, some fellow crackers capable of carrying on and ameliorate the 

kind of work I was trying to do.

  The "Instant Access" strainer was -alas!- much too hard for the "scene" 

knowledge of that time (I believe that now many of you would crack that 

crap much more easily). And I got very few answers. My luck was that I

have found very good students among those few.

  Unfortunately in the last two semesters I was taken by other projects 

(which have much more to do with 'history cracking' than with software 

cracking as +gthorne knows :=) and I did not have the time to follow my 

very good (and few) students.

 Yet their work nonetheless (or may be for this very reason :=) went

beyond all my expectancies: fravia+ and +gthorne, with the help of +Sync, 

did develop something that surpasses by far, for contents and available 

free knowledge, anything I had ever seen on the net before.

  A real "Academy" (as fravia+ has called it) of software deprotection 

that serves already now as comprehensive reference for all 'protectionists'

and de-protectionists alike (and you should hear the deference and 

admiration that has been expressed by some 'very high' software bonzes 

for many of the essays that have been published there :=)

  The "Microsoft" strainer of April 1997 inside my lesson 4.2 found a much

greater audience. Potius sero, quam nunquam. Inside our 1998 +HCU courses 

we will have a dozen of students, clearly too many to be followed and tutored 

as they deserve by me alone.

  I will therefore create once more various 'units', but this time I'll 

try to place inside each one of them some experienced crackers together 

with some less experienced ones. each unit will be targeted towards some 

specific project (yet of course anyone will be able to swap courses if 

he likes so).

  Next year we will therefore have a REAL university (or at least the 

beginning of it). It will of course be completely free, for anybody that 

has deserved it through is work.

  I'll personally invite some "famous" crackers (friends of mine) to give 

you "ad hoc" (or ad personam) specific courses... and during our 1998 

academic year we will meet (figuratively speaking :=) some eminent "hacker" 

personality too.

  The "real" universities of yesterday have also been a cosmopolite meeting 

point... people from many nations and languages and social situations have 

brought there their personal contribution... this allowed formidable 

progresses and an incredible evolution of the societies of those times.

  Our society has come to an awful regression point. Useless nationalism 

and petty provincial attitudes are rampant (even inside the 'real world' 

universities :=( while at the same time few international commercial oligarchs 

are dominating the whole world as if it where a conquered "Unicum".

  Everything seems to be geared towards consume and money, as if the main

wish of humanity should consist in an 'hamster' life, hoarding useless 

gadgets and munching them with full cheeks while loosing at the same time 

more and more all the precious attributes that form the "quality of life".

  Software will be used in that sense too: giving them more and more <U>

VIRTUAL</U> life quality and hiddenly stealing the last real bits of it.

 

  Our university will be really 'universal'... some of you may -already 

now- have many friends from different <U>continents</U>, good friends 

that they may never have met, but that they read and/or hear every day, 

friends that 'in the real world' come in all varieties of colours, 

religions, beliefs and costumes. It's the human race coming together 

anew after dozen of thousands of years, something that our forefathers 

could only have dreamed of. It's a vulcan we are sitting on, and we should 

contribute to crack it open.

  In fact for once in history our diversities make us STRONG instead than 

feeble. They help us to develop even quicker than our masters. It's an old 

lesson: when the provincialism of a closed society is broken, 

when input and ideas can circulate freely (and the anonymity of the web 

plays a very important catalitic role in all this) then an incredible 

rhythm can be conveyed to the development of each one of us.

  Let's also not forget that our very craving for knowledge, together with 

our longing for justice, represents already now a considerable power, a 

power that some of our enemies are beginning to feel. We are at the right 

place in the right moment, don't forget it never.



  I would like to try to perform an 'assessment' of the capabilities of 

each one of you that goes byond the (easy) strainer that you have solved 

this sommer. You are not compelled to take part to this 'project', and 

since you passed the strainer you'll be admitted to the courses on the 

first of January anyway, of course, yet if you only find the time, I 

would like you all to partecipate, I would like more elements to 'group' 

you for the courses. 

Besides I believe that this project is interesting per se (I got the idea 

for this project from lazy fravia+ :=)

  

<U>The Acrobat project, preparation for the 1998 +HCU courses</U>



  ACROBAT FORMAT FILES security settings have not yet been cracked, 

AFAIK, and therefore this makes the target a very nice (and very 

interesting and very important) project to work on.

Acrobat format files are those  *.pdf files in portable document 

format that you can only read (yet not write) with the free Adobe 

reader. The idea behind this being, as usual, common greed. If Adobe 

had given to anybody reader and acrobat (writer) for free, this (very 

good) format would have been by now the standard on the web. 

Yet they just wanted to make money. Result: only few people are using 

this. We'll change all this right now!



<U>First</U> (this should be easy if you work in group):

Defeat the security settings: a PDF document author can choose to 

restrict access to a file by requiring an open password or 

by restricting the use of certain tools and commands.

If a file requires an open password, you must enter the password to view 

the file. When a file has restricted access, any restricted tools and 

menu items are dimmed. We don't like 'restricted access' per definition, 

so crack this :=)



<U>Second</U> (this is a little more difficult, but you'll have great 

satisfaction if and when you master it): a good comprehension of this pdf 

format will allow you to quickly write a *.txt ==> *.pdf file converter 

which we will then distribute (of course for free) on the net.

Yes, we'll do now that what Adobe should have madeby itself long ago. 

                                                            

De nihilo, nihil:

You'll find some first info (and you'll be able to download reader) at

http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/

At the beginning of your work you'll quikly find out that there 

is already a first (bad) attempt at cracking this format on the web.

Actually it is not a 'crack', but a programmer that wanted to port 

acrobat to another platform (and had some problems with Adobe, of 

course). You'll be able to download there some files specifications 

that will spare you a lot of work.

You'll have to perform some social engineering as well, in order to 

get the info you need: that is good, a good cracker IS a social engineer.



I believe you'll have to work a little to crack this project which 

will teach you a lot in my opinion, and there is another advantage: 

THIS CAN BE SOLVED ONLY IF YOU WORK TOGETHER, i.e. not alone, try 

by yourself to form little groups, you'll see how quikly you'll get 

to the solution thattaway.



Work well

<I>Well, I received this four 

hours ago from 

+ORC's hotmail identity (as usual the original ID that hotmail lets through when you 

send from it is useless: 

some 'spare' one month trial AOL account that +he just fakes, uses and 

throws away :-) 

and I decided to publish immediately. Indeed I seem to have 

(unvoluntarly) given him this whole idea: I wrote him that I had received 

some (pretty good) tutorials by Ghiribizzo, yet these were in *.pdf protected 

format, and I did not wanted to publish them as such. I told him that I had 

only Adobe Reader, and that i did not have Adobe Acrobat. 

His answer was typical:</I></CENTER><BR>

<PRE>

    Well crack them nevertheless. You don't need Acrobat to crack that crap, 

    Reader is more than enough... and come to think of it, once you have 

    understood pdf, write a converter, that format would for sure look nice 

    for the essays... formositas dimidium dotis. Besides, having done it all 

    of your own will give you some more glory.

</PRE><I><CENTER>

So I am very happy with this project, and I hope we all will succeed.<BR>
