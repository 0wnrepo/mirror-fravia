"We had only positive feedback after we questioned the media's assault on Kennedy

trivia and the torrent of "national grief" which was <BR>spoon fed to us for one

solid week as the rest of the world news respectfully stood still. One has to

wonder if the cure for war, pestilence <BR>and poverty could be achieved simply by

flying one Kennedy into the sea each week. If television news and specials can be

used as an indicator, the answer is a resounding "yes". Hardly a mention of

anything else was heard for seven days and we must assume there was a complete

halt to hostilities in Kosovo and all was well with the rest of the world.

<BR><BR>I opt for Teddy to be next week's offering. <BR><BR>One last editorial

comment and we shall leave the subject:<BR>--------------<BR>A CASE STUDY IN

SELF-LOVE<BR><BR>This week was a big revenue booster for the networks and a high

stage for their talkinghead netwonks.  Not since Princess Diana's Mercedes<BR>Benz

decelerated from 120mph into a Paris tunnel abutment has so much media hype been

heaped on a deceased member of the glitterati. <BR><BR>The numbers released by

Nielsen indicate that viewership of CNN, MSNBC and FNC nonstop Kennedy coverage

exceeded previous highs set after Princess Di's death.  Are congratulations in

order? <BR><BR>The death of kindred social celebrities sparks endless fascination

among media celebrities -- undoubtedly because these elites view themselves in

such esteem as to think they are eternal fixtures, invincible.  But such "news"

coverage obfuscates the line between journalists and paparazzi, if such a line

still exists.  More<BR>importantly, it exposes the celebrity media's preoccupation

with itself.  <BR><BR>One can speculate whether or not the coverage afforded young

John Kennedy would be afforded, say, conservative radio talk-show host Michael

Reagan, son of President Reagan, should he meet an untimely demise.  We estimate

the latter would rate little more than a footnote. (Sorry, Michael.) He just does

not fit the media elite's<BR>self-image.<BR><BR>The coverage of Princess Diana's

death provided a template for understanding the media's vicarious projection of

its own thin values. To wit: Who else died that fateful week in 1997? (Hint: Her

name was at least as widely known as that of the princess.) Does Mother Teresa

come to mind? If not, perhaps it is because the talkingheads barely gave lip

service to her lifetime of achievement during the flood of Diana coverage.

<BR><BR>Of course, Mother Teresa did not die en route to Martha's Vineyard or

rushing to her yacht  after an evening at the Ritz in Paris. She died quietly,

surrounded by members of her Catholic order in a barren room in Calcutta, leaving

a personal estate of three blue-bordered saris in<BR>the colors of her

Missionaries of Charity.  The glitterati can't identify with that. And the TV

media were not alone in their disproportionate coverage.  A summary of pages in

the hallowed weekly print media dedicated to Princess Diana and Mother Teresa,

respectively: Newsweek 47 vs. 4, Time 41 vs. 7, and U.S. News & World Report 16

vs. 2.<BR><BR>The ACU's Craig Shirley noted at the time, "By the end of the week,

I felt certain Diana would be transformed by the media from royal celebrity to

martyred saint.  I was wrong. The  transformation took less than 24 hours." And

that brings us back to John-John, who, as media editor Wes Pruden notes, "at

38...had the gifts of good looks, charm and enough wealth to indulge harmless

hobbies, among them his airplane and his magazine, George." <BR><BR>Consider these

tributes: "It's been decades since the label of 'Our Royal Family' was applied to

the Kennedys. But now with another generation climbing the political ladder with

another unbelievable meeting of joy and sorrow, this may be one of the rare times

when a manufactured media label may actually be close to the mark." --CNN's Jeff

Greenfield. ++ "Now of the young family that once made the White House into

Camelot, only one is still among us -- Caroline." --ABC's Beth Nissen with another

"manufactured media label."  ++   "JFK Jr. was the closest thing this country had

to a prince." --Today's Matt Lauer  ++ "I suppose...he was the prince for all of

us." --ABC's Sam Donaldson  ++  "A tribute to America's son. ... We

Americans...have <BR>long been fascinated by the Kennedy mystique." --CBS's Dan

Rather  <BR><BR>"Royal family"? "Camelot"? "Prince for us all"? These are all

images conjured by the media -- a luxurious trough for glitterati wallowing<BR>and

mesmerizing the masses.  Columnist Michael Kelly concludes, "Indeed, the absence

of true grief is what makes it possible to wallow in vicarious grief. The media

understand and exploit this. People are product. The more symbolic the person, the

greater value of the product. (This is why Hillary Clinton on the cover

guarantees<BR>newsstand sales; she is almost pure symbol.) Everything that happens

to symbolic people is product. Especially death; nothing sells like<BR>symbolic

death." <BR><BR>The most arrogant of the media elites set about exploiting the

tragedy as a catalyst for  historical revision. Almost 30 years to the

day<BR>after a drunken Ted Kennedy drove his car off a small bridge on Martha's

Vineyard, only miles from where his nephew met his end, ABC News listed among

"Kennedy Family Tragedies" -- "1969: Ted Kennedy in car crash in Chappaquiddick in

which Mary Jo Kopechne died." We were under the impression that was a Kopechne

family tragedy. <BR><BR>ABC even crowned the "royal family's" patriarch,

president. Referring to Ted Kennedy, Peter Jennings reported, "Also in his

statement today,<BR>President Kennedy said what Kennedys have said before on

occasions like this, this family sort of helps to appease its grief if you will,

he said by putting its faith in God."  ABC's Barbara Walters followed with, "Prime

Minister Barak...was very pleased with his visit with<BR>President Kennedy...."

(We checked, and Mr. Kennedy is still a Senator.) <BR><BR>Wes Pruden concludes, "

'Losing the horizon' is not a phenomenon peculiar to novice pilots, but a common

affliction of our celebrity culture. Nobody loses the horizon faster, or has more

trouble determining which end is up, than the talkingheads on television when

entertainment tragedy strikes."<BR><BR>The irony is that John Kennedy, like

Princess Diana, loathed gratuitous media exploitation of the variety which

followed their deaths.  Under the false pretense of such exploitation, the

humanity of the exploited is desecrated.  Of course, the talkingheads counter that

couch potatoes are to blame because they demand all the celebrity hype -- a

"chicken or egg" proposition. But how does such an accusation distinguish

journalist from  paparazzi? <BR><BR>
