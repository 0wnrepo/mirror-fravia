What is combing?<br>

Combing is a very effective search strategy: instead of simply searching, 

you 'milk' (or 'comb') various other net resources:<br>

</i><pre>

<b><font color="green">-</font></b> The continuously updated &quot;Top 100&quot;, &quot;Top 1000&quot;, &quot;Top whatever&quot; URL-locations

<b><font color="green"> </font></b> ('Real' combing)

<b><font color="green">-</font></b> Usenet newsgroups and their various &quot;vigilant filters&quot; and &quot;short range queries&quot;

<b><font color="green"> </font></b> (Usenet combing)

<b><font color="green">-</font></b> Relevant site links pages.

<b><font color="green"> </font></b> (a form of 'crumbs gathering', see my anti-smut pages)

<i></pre>  

<hr><center><font size="+2"><font color="purple">Real combing: The WebSideStory example</font></font></center>

<br>Best way to learn combing is to have a try by yourself:

Let's take as example (yet there are THOUSAND of these 'top whatever'sites) 

one counter-related site that I have been using myself (it offers quick 

text-only stats and awful graphic stats): WEBSIDE STORY.<br>

Here is websidestory's self-praise:<font color="purple"><pre>

Updated every four hours. Last update Mon Nov 3 12:00:01 1997 - PST

WebSideStory, Inc. currently monitors 30,783 sites who have 15,264,666 visitors per day.

There are 22,750 sites listed in 36 categories, averaging 1,996,241 visitors per day.

</pre></font> 

The problem with all these 'top whatever' sites is that you oft 

have to wade trough a lot of pages to get where you are interested, 

because the poor sods want you to read their awful ads. <br>

Famous Listing of the Best Sites on the Internet</a><br><br> 

In the case of Websidestory you'll

 for instance first land at http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world.html:<br>

<img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0"><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world.html'" tppabs="http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world.html">WebSideStory's</a> first page

<br> 

Yet you'll eventually land inside this second page (divided by categories):<br>

<img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN="BOTTOM" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0"><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world2.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world2.html'" tppabs="http://www.hitbox.com/wc/world2.html">Websidestory's</a> second page<br>

<hr>Now you have seen it...<br>

Obviously combing is an important technique for whatever interest you may 

have, quite effective and pretty  

useful in order to spare an incredible lot of Internet searching <u>hours</u>.

<br><br>

For combing purposes you may also use:

<br>

<font color="red">1</font>) ftp search, looking for &quot;hidden&quot; subdirectories with relevant names  

<br>

	As anybody that knows how to use  

<img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="13" ALT="red"></a><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://ftpsearch.unit.no/ftpsearch/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://ftpsearch.unit.no/ftpsearch/'" tppabs="http://ftpsearch.unit.no/ftpsearch/">ftp search</a> (&quot;This server is located in 

Trondheim, Norway&quot;)

 already experienced, the ftp search approach (that fishes hidden directories) 

can fish incredible (if tricky to interpret) results.<br> Just do a quick search for 

'warez' and you'll see what I mean.

<hr>





<font color="red">2</font>) the &quot;big page provider&quot; search engines</pre>

(Like the search engines that work page specific for geocities at

Usenet combing can work &quot;on the fly&quot; or &quot;regularly&quot; through the &quot;Vigilant&quot; 

 filter at<br><pre>

filter@vigilant.bc.ca</pre>

I'll show you for instance one of my favourite simple queries:<pre>

FIND how-to-search tutorial manual

		NOT spam

		NOT top position

		NOT advertising

		MAX 8</pre>

Such a query would give you useful information about &quot;searching techniques&quot; on 

the Web, you may of course construct how many queries you like and *register* 

(for free) by the vigilant filter, in order to get 

the results of your usenet queries emailed to you every day or week or 

month.<br><br>

<hr SIZE="2">&nbsp;

<center><font size="+2"><font COLOR="purple">__klebing__</font></font></center>

<center>Fishing query strings and locations</center><br>

Klebing is a 'reversing search' technique that goes ways beyond 

&quot;combing&quot;. And which offers incredible value. We will clear out 

what klebing is, below, using a ready made example on a site 

that you'll probably already know (it is an important hacker site and I link

  to it myself inside  

my <a href="links.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/links.htm">links</a> page):	here is the 'normal' 

URL of that site: <img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"><a HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://l0pht.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://l0pht.com/'" tppabs="http://l0pht.com/">L0pht  heavy

industries</a>.<br> We can use LOpht for this example because LOpht 

has (publicly) the 'row material' that we need for klebing: the 'remote connexions' list.

It is basically a very 

simple 	CGI-script, that updates inside its own database (LOpht updates every day) 

all the &quot;remote&quot; URL locations (i.e. the sites the various visitors come from) accessing any of the pages of a given site. 

<br>You may easily write such an analogouus spider and add 

it to your site! In order to write quickly (and dirty) 

a 'crude' CGI-script like this you 

just need to list all the 

<font color="purple">var where = document.referrer</font> variables that any 

lamer's browser carries inside (well... not our reversed and 'ameliorated' 

browsers... in order to learn the relevant techniques you may want to have 

a look at Mammon_'s <a href="mammop5.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/mammop5.htm">Reversing Netscape's buttons and 

menus</a> essay... my copy of Netscape carries for instance a different random 

-and of course faked- <font color="purple">document.referrer</font> variable everytime it accesses a new 

site :-)<br><br>

Well, have a look at the next link and you'll understand what I mean:<br>

Here you have the real, updated LOpht's location you'll use yourself 

in order to perform your updated klebing endeavours: 

<img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.l0pht.com/ref.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.l0pht.com/ref.html'" tppabs="http://www.l0pht.com/ref.html">http://www.l0pht.com/ref.html</a><br><br>



And here you have a copy of it that you should examine 

NOW in order to better follow what I'm telling you.<br>

 In order to  

discuss together with you some of the 'results' of 

our klebing activities I have copied a 'still image' of this 

continuously updating database inside my site, talen from the location 

above 

on 4 Nov 1997 (to-day), here it is: 

<img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0" WIDTH="13" HEIGHT="13"><a href="lophtrev.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/lophtrev.htm">lophtrev.htm</a><br>

<br>

So, now that you had a look at them, let's say a couple of things:<br>

<font color="red">1</font>)	The utility of such a script from the Webmaster's point of view 

is obvious: he can immediately see 

WHO is sending hits to him and WHERE inside his site does he link to (and 

he can 'punish' eventual  

'fastidious' linking inside his site simply modifying 

the <u>name</u> of the branched 

pages, like I'll do soon with the academy section of my site if you keep entering from the 

sides to my pages :-(

<br>

<font color="red">2</font>)	The utility of such a script (if publicly presented, like 

this by LOpht, or else 

if 'somehow' findbar inside a /cgi subdirectory -see my antismut pag for the 

relevant CGI-cracking techniques :-) is for our search purposes HUGE! If the site 

has some attinence with fields you are interested in (and LOphts for sure 

has it with sites that may interest us!) 

you are in for a surprise... in fact one wonders what's the point 

of laboriously browsing the web in search of possible new intersting 

sites where you could eventually learn something! Let 

those same sites COME TO YOU all by themselves alone... isn't it nice?

<br><br>



In fact, what do we have here?	  <br>

Let's have a look at some intersting little fishes:<br>

Yahoo and excite for instance, find both this site through the cdc cult<br>

<font color="purple">

1409  |  http://www.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Religion/Humor/Parody_Religions/Cult_of_the_Dead_Cow/ -&gt; /cdc.html<br>

 125  |  http://www.excite.com/search.gw?trace=1&amp;search=hackers -&gt; /cdc.html<br>

</font>

'our' astalavista is also present:<br>

<font color="purple">

124  |  http://astalavista.box.sk/cgi-bin/marek/robot/robot?srch=warez -&gt; /lounge.html<br>

</font>

Note thet there is already something that may be interesting for you (albeit 

well known by all search-experts): the <font color="red">FORM</font> that an 

excite or astalavista query takes!<br>

Yes, if you have read my previous letters, you'll have seen that it is possible 

to query search engines per email using URL addresses like:<br><font color="purple">  

http://lycos11.lycos.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/flpursuit?first=1\\&amp;maxhits=30\\

&amp;minterms=1\\&amp;minscore=0.01\\&amp;terse=standard\\&amp;query=linguistic+phenomena         

</font><br>

Therefore we have here a simple 'template' that we can immediatly use for OTHER

queries... c'mon: try it out: cut and paste the following line:<br>

<font color="purple">http://www.excite.com/search.gw?trace=1&amp;search=hackers</font><br>

that we have found through our klebing work, and paste it inside the 'location' 

window of your copy of navigator...<br>

Have you done it?<br>

Well, now backspace over <font color="purple">hackers</font> and digit instead 

<font color="purple">crackers</font><br>.

Now press enter and have a look: your own ready-made excite search string!<br>

And youll find THOUSAND of powerful and frequent or funny and seldom used 

'query string' possibilities trough 

this klebing method... d'you understand now how POWERFUL this can be?

<hr> <center>

<fon size="+2">New strings</font></center>   

Back to our klebing page... as you can see, in order to land 

somewhere at LOft a part of these visitors has used Yahoo and has 

searched for 'hackers', 'attress', 'spycamera' and more<br>

Now, some of these are banal, like 'hackers', yet some are quite 

interesting, like 'email intercepting'.<br>

This can also be quite interesting... I have quite a lot of ready-made 

strings that I use with the search engines, and some of them I have gathered 

klebing sites... else I would probably never have come to some ideas.

<hr> <center>

<fon size="+2">Watch the watchers</font></center> 

Some of our enemies have sites somewhere that tehy use to check us... it may 

be quite interesting to snoop onto those sites... through klebing you'll get 

them... have a look at what we have here at LOpht:<br>  

    316  |  http://www.microsoft.com/security/ntprod.htm -&gt; /advisories.html<br>

103  |  http://www.microsoft.com/security/issues.htm -&gt; /advisories.html<br>



<hr> <center>

<fon size="+2">Unknown mysteries</font></center>   

 This one links to a cgi-bin page... why?:<br> 

<font color="purple"> 

  105  |  http://nowhere/nothing.html -&gt; /cgi-bin/Count.cgi<br>

</font>

well, this tells us<br>

 FIRST<br>

 That there is indeed a cgi-bin directory here with a Count.cgi script and<br>

 SECOND<br>

 that <font color="purple">nowhere/nothing</font> is interested in it.<br>

<hr> <center>

<fon size="+2">Old friends</font></center>   



 And who the hell is this next one? Our good old friend Bokler from Deja? (See my
