fravia's page of reverse engineering<HR><I>Well, here is a VERY INTERESTING 

essay, many of us have had, at a given moment, BIG problems 

downloading uuencoded (or 64ed) software from the Web. As I explain elsewhere, you 

can avoid many problems, most of the time, using a good ftpmailer, 

and getting your software sent home, for free, in chunks as big as 

you fancy... yet there are, as from the kenZone pointed out, 

moments where you'll be desperate for a missing chunk of an huge 

data block... and then you'll be very GLAD that you did read 

THIS essay, believe me.</I></CENTER><HR size="6">

<B>

<I>&quot;What good is reverse engineering if you can't get<BR>

the warez you really want?&quot;</I>

</B>

</CENTER>

<BR><BR>



There comes a point in your search for software that is simply not

available online in any form.... except for what's in the newsgroup supermarket.

The features and functions may not be present in shareware, demoware, crippleware, 

you get the idea right?. Most of the real valuable software is usually quite large and 

commonly spans across 10+ disks.<BR>

<BR>

When browsing the binaries.warez groups with your newsreader it is real 

common to see very large postings that don't always arrive completely intact. 

The common trend is to post the warez in 10k to 15k+ line chunks. This cuts down

on the number of parts and thus cuts down on the number that can go missing. 

The completeness of the posting that arrives to your server or to the point at 

which you can intercept it is generally out of your direct control.

So get yourself a well connected server which will help avoid <B>some</B> trouble.<BR>

<BR>

Even if you are well connected and see the entire post there stands a good 

chance you can't download all 47 disks of Adobe Superduper Pagemaker before your 

server deletes it when you use anything less than a 28,800 modem.<BR>

If the individual that posted the specific warez you're after should happen

to repost what you need untouched, you don't have to worry about downloading the

pieces to make things complete.<BR>

<BR>

However when the disks are reposted in a different size from the original or 

from a different individual, a certain degree of hesitation occurres because you're 

not really sure if this repost is the same as the original, hence it would be a 

waste of time to download the needed pieces and find it to be absolutely worthless 

because they have been altered. <BR>

<BR>

<B>Note: </B>The regular contributors and users to the warez groups are very good at keeping the 

files as they are so no problems do arise. Many individuals will indicate in the

&quot;<B>Subject: </B>&quot; header who originally posted it with the original file name. This gives

some assurance that it'll be unaltered and safe to use with what you've captured earlier.  <BR>

<BR>

Soooooo.... As long as we know that the repost is exactly the same, we are no longer worried

about the number of pieces and/or the size of them because what I'm about to present

here allows you to take parts of the repost and fill in the missing pieces without having

to continously recapture entire files/disks because <FONT COLOR="ff0000">one stupid part</FONT> didn't get through.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="25%" SIZE="3">

<BR>

<CENTER><FONT size="+1"><B>Enough of this, lets get on with it!</B></FONT></CENTER>

<BR>

Below is an explaination of how you can save what you have captured with your newsreader

and fill in the missing parts you need to make it all complete. Generally speaking you want to

do this if your trying to save yourself the trouble of re-downloading a rather large file or

you have a slow connection that draws things out well beyond comfort. Or two different

individuals posted the exact same file but neither of them came through completely intact.<BR>

<HR WIDTH="25%" SIZE="3">

<BR>

<PRE>

<B>Things to know first:</B>

<B>1.</B>Most common posting formats is UUE or Base64.

<B>2.</B>Whether the encoded binary file is posted in one single part or 5000+ parts

  the encoded file remains the same, only the number of parts change.

<B>3.</B>Either of these formats can be easily manipulated with a text editor.

<B>4.</B>Both files <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">must</FONT></B> be of the same encoded format.

  We can't patch a UUE file with Base64 or the other way around either. (yet)

<B>5.</B>The repost of the file can<B><FONT COLOR="ff0000"> not</FONT></B> be re-archived whatsoever (no changes allowed!!!).

  In order to patch two seperate postings together we need to be able to find the 

  overlaping area that will allow us to cut and paste things together.

<B>6.</B>The larger the parts the less files you have to manipulate and have to patch.

<B>7.</B>Since most newsreaders (I think all) will not allow for repairing and patching

  and/or installing the missing files and/or contents we have to do it manually.

<B>8.</B>Everything concerning this subject <B><FONT COLOR="ff0000">is</FONT></B> case sensitive.



<B>Req'd tools:</B> 

<B>1.</B>Text editor with string search and capable of handling text in excess of 2 megs.

<B>2.</B>UUdecode, WinCode, or equiv. WinZip 6.2/32 will work for single files.

<B>3.</B>Calculator. c:\windows\calc.exe will do.

</PRE>

<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>How to locate joints and decide if it's worth the effort:</B></FONT><BR>

<BR>

<B>Use the following diagram as a visual reference as I explain how it's done.</B></CENTER>

<BR>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="chart.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/chart.gif" WIDTH="690" HEIGHT="321"></CENTER>

<BR>





<B>If</B> you have attempted to download a large file that is missing pieces and

the repost is of different section sizes it may not be worth patching

if the piece you need is located where two other large pieces come together.

As shown in the chart there are many places of overlap from one posting to

another.<BR>

<BR><PRE>

<B>Example One: </B>Using chart<BR><BR>

<B>If</B> the missing part happens to be:



                                   (17/43) @ 900 lines

                                     (3/6) @ 7000 lines

                                     (2/4) @ 11000 lines

                                    --------------------

                                    Repost @ 15000 lines

</PRE>

The missing lines you require would be located in two large parts that covers about 75% of the repost.

Kind of useless unless of coarse the last piece didn't get through and you have that portion of it.

Besides this is hardly worth the effort if all you're after is a single disk sized posting.

But if the file is a single 9 meg ZIP you sure don't want to download the whole thing again.

<BR><BR>

<B>Example Two: </B>Without chart<BR><BR>

<B>If</B> for example the piece you need is (34/43) @ 900 lines then add up all the 

previous lines together or take 34 and multiply it by the size of the 'posted parts'.<BR>

<BR><PRE>

eg: 34 X 900 = 30600



<B>If</B> the result is within the 'posted size' of the 'repost' then

the piece you're after is located on a joint.



eg: 34  X  900 = 30600   post   @ 900

     2 X 15000 = 30000   repost @ 15000

                 -----

                   600 - 900 = <FONT color="#ff0000" size="+2"><B>-</B></FONT>300 lines located in previous part.

</PRE><BR>

This example shows that the first 300 lines and the last 600 lines are located

in two seperate parts of the repost.

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="25%" SIZE="3">

<BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>How to determine what you need:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<PRE>

<B>1.</B>Take the position (xx/??) of the missing piece.

<B>2.</B>Multiply it's part number by the 'posted size'

<B>3.</B>The result will give the position of the last encoded line.

  Subtract the posting size from this amount to give you

  the beginning encoded line.



 eg: missing part (17/109) @ 1234 lines.

 

     17 X 1234 = 20978   ;gives the last line

  20978 - 1234 = 19744   ;gives the first line



    So we're after everything from lines 19744 to 20978.



If the repost is at 15000 lines then:



     Part (1/x) @ 15000     ;gives lines 1 to 15000

     Part (2/x) @ 15000     ;gives lines 15001 to 30000

     Part (3/x) @ 15000     ;gives lines 30001 to 45000

     Etc....



Part (2/x) will meet our requirements if the archive has not been altered.



</PRE>

So the first thing to do is extract and save all the parts you have to file.<BR>

eg: 001.uue ,002.uue, etc... <BR>

It best to keep the file names close to the actual parts that they belong too.<BR>

<BR>

And extract and save the donation parts to file.<BR>

eg: d01.uue ,d02.uue, etc....<BR>

<BR>

Now with everything in text form, we goto work.<BR>

<BR>

<HR WIDTH="25%" SIZE="3">

<BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>How to stick it all together:</B></FONT></CENTER>

<BR>

Once we have enough of the parts that cover over all the holes, we need to

find <B>where</B> to fit things together.

Since none of the parts have been decoded back into it's original state and

it still remains in text form, we'll use a text editor.<BR><BR>

Lets assume the piece that's missing is (1/xx) and you have whats required

to patch it up.<BR>

<PRE>



<B>1. Open</B> part (2/xx) or the part directly after the missing piece with your text editor.

<B>2. Edit--Copy</B> the first line of the encoded text.

<B>3. Open</B> the donating file with your text editor.

<B>4. Edit--Paste</B> the string into the search funcion of the editor.

  a. If you can't find a match either you've searching the wrong file,

  b. there is a space at the beginning or at the end of the search string,

  c. or the file your searching through does not match and has been altered thus you're screwed.

  d. <FONT color="#ff0000">Also keep in mind you must work case sensitive!!!</FONT>



When you find the string, just <B>Copy</B> everything above it <B>not</B> including

the found string.

<B>Open</B> a <B>New</B> document and <B>Paste</B> in the captured contents.

<B>SaveAs</B> 001.uue or whatever is needed to <B>make up</B> the missing file.



<B>OR</B>

</PRE>

<B>ReOpen</B> (2/xx) and <B>Paste</B> the captured contents at the top. Making sure

there is no spaces between it and the encoded text below it.<BR><BR>

Now if the part you need to recover is located at the tail end, then the procedure is the same

except your just working towards the bottom.<BR><BR>

<B>If</B> that is all the patching needed, then fire up your favorite decoder.

<BR><BR>

<B>Now</B> the only thing left is extracting the text lines needed to make a component

that happens to be located inside the donation file.

The procedure is only a matter of isolation. With the parts located on either side of

the missing piece all you need to do is search for the last line in the previous part

and do a search for the first line in the follow part and isolate/Copy the contents between

these two.<BR><BR>

Now you just <B>SaveAs</B> the contents to whatever filename (????.uue) that is

required for your decoder to properly extract the contents.<BR><BR>

So as you can see this is not at all difficult. It's just a matter of text manipulation.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Note:</B> The reason why I say delete the found search string is because

you already have that line of text from which you got the search string from.

A duplication of text lines will corrupt the file to a point where it may not be

usable in any way.<BR><BR>



<FONT color="#bb0000"><B>This set of procedures that I have discribed above is basically for extreme measures. In

most cases you won't have to go this far, but sometimes circumstances can go against you.

You now have aquired knowledge of a solution to a possible problem that may occur.</B></FONT><BR>

<HR WIDTH="100%" SIZE="3"><BR><BR>

<CENTER><FONT size="+2"><B>Previewing the contents of ZIP files before downloading them.</B></FONT>

<HR WIDTH="50%" SIZE="3"></CENTER><BR>

The idea of ZIP placing the table of contents at the bottom of the archive is

actually a blessing in disguise. Because of this we can download the last part

of a warez posting and view the contents of it without having to download all of it.<BR><BR>

This can come in handy if you happen to have a corrupted file from a posting that you

have aquired earlier. If you're after a specific *.exe, *.dll or *.cab whatever....you maybe able to

find it's location before wasting time downloading everything to get it.<BR><BR>

<PRE>

There is only 5 steps required to pull this off.

<B>1.</B> Capture and <B>Save Message As</B> the last part of the posting.

<B>2a.For UUE:

   Open</B> the file with a text editor and add: <FONT color="#0000aa"><B>begin 644 filename.zip</B></FONT>

   at the very top of the encoded text. (It should look like the example below).

<B>2b.For Base64:

   Open</B> the file with a text editor and add:

                         <B><FONT color="#ff0000">* </FONT><FONT color="#0000aa">Content-Type: application\octet-stream; name=&quot;filename.zip

                           Content-Transfer-Encoding: Base64

                         <FONT color="#ff0000">* </FONT>Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=&quot;filename.zip&quot;</FONT>

                           (SPACE)</B>

   (It should look like the example below).

<B><FONT color="#ff0000">    *</FONT></B> Winzip 6.2/32 or equiv. only needs <B>one</B> of these two lines.

<B>3.</B> Decode the file.

<B>4. </B>Run Pkzipfix.exe on the decoded zip file that was just created.

<B>5.</B> Now view the contents of the repaired zip file.

</PRE>

You will notice a slight pattern change in the area of the encoded file

where the table of contents is located.

For UUE it'll be more   ```````    in the area.

For Base64 it'll be more  AAAAAAAA.
