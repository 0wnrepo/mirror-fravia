<HR>

<I>Well, the subject of this page has, as far as I know, 

not yet being treated on the Web... I hope to receive 

MANY contributions in order to develop this in a full-fledged 

SECTOR of my page.<BR>

I too believe, like +ORC, that publicity has taken an 

insopportable place in our lifes, and that we are MADE 

to consum and nothing more.<BR>

I'll therefore begin this page with a very interesting example, 

written (nothing less! :-) by +ORC himself (after some exithation):<BR><B><H2>supermarket enslavement secrets</B></H2><BR>

March 1997__</FONT></H3>

</CENTER><BR><CENTER>Ok, Fravia convinced me to publish separate without 

interpolating all this in my tut, coz it would have been too heavy, 

even if in my opinion it is part of cracking and he may be 

wrong, coz nobody will read my crap if I don't mix it with 

software cracking info, coz people do not want to learn to be

free, and to free them we have sadly to &quot;circumvent&quot; them with more or 

less the same techniques that our enemies use to enslave them :=)<BR>

<BR>Let's crack the very 

temples of the enemies of the humanity and poetry, 

the prisons where we are forced to buy and consume... 

let's show all idiots the WHIPS that are used to enslave them... 

as always light comes through knowledge<BR>

Remeber that NOTHING is casual in this awful society where people are 

CULTIVATED to consume and nothing else than that. Around you almost

 everything has a &quot;secret&quot; meaning, that you are not supposed 

 to see, understand or crack (see the codebar example in my C1 lesson, 

 which is my best contribution so far to this cause :=)

Knowledge is real power... it's not just a phrase! And Internet gives 

us (at least until now) the possibility to spread knowledge. They spread 

shit ads, useless information and publicity, we spread &quot;real&quot; knowledge... we'll win<BR>

<BR>Let's begin with 

some simple basic counter-intelligence work... You'll never watch your 

mall or supermarkt with the same eyes after having read this<BR>

<BR></CENTER><HR>

<B>The entrance is on the right, yet you walk left, duh</B>

In all modern supermarket the slave MUST follow a counterclockwise 

direction: 95% of the population of the world has a slight imperfected 

equilibrium, they tend to the left... if you leave somebody alone lost 

in the desert (don't do it :=) he'll begin tu turn round counterclockwise. 

That's the reason ALL modern supermarket have a &quot;counterclockwise&quot; 

layout... which btw has other consequences and hidden meanings, as you will 

see in the following<BR>

<BR><B>Why do they start with fresh fruit?</B><BR>

Reason Number 1:  

People coming inside a supermarket tend to conserve the velocity and the 

inertia of the streets... they would &quot;jump&quot; the first 10 meters of 

merchandises if you did not stop them with the explosion of colours and 

smells that only fresh fruit can offer.<BR>

Reason number 2: 

The supermarket are subjected to the strong concurrence of the &quot;discount&quot; 

malls (&quot;poor people&quot; supermarkts, the ones with ugly boxes and cheaper 

prices), which do not have fresh fruit, but (mostly) only conserves... 

first thing when he comes in: the slave must be assured, palping a red 

nice apple, that he is in an &quot;exquisite&quot; special frish shop.<BR>

<BR>

Note that the disposition of the fruit and vegetables is NOT casual 

(far from it). The whole point in supermarket enslavement is that the 

very few thing that are really useful and must be bought are overwhelmed 

and interpolated with completely useless products and/or with much more 

expensive varieties and qualities, because of the huge profits on those 

articles and of the smaller profits on basic products.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Light dances in your eyes, sounds enter your hears

</B><BR>Orange and apples with a lot of mirrors, Bananes and pears with a

 green surrounding, salats and potatos with clear light... red for meat 

 (coz white light would make grey) and so on... have a look at the illumination 

tricks in your mall next time you are compelled to go in.<BR>

Note also that the quiet music 

is necessary: the supermarkt would seem &quot;dead&quot; without it, but it must 

not be too heavy... and it changes too... they know exactly at which time 

of the day seniores and at which time youngsters slaves go consuming inside, 

you'll have therefore music which is &quot;calibrated&quot; on the time of the day.

<BR><BR>

<B>Expensive is easy, cheap is difficult

</B><BR>Producte are so positionated that the expensive ones are ALWAYS 

&quot;towards&quot; the march direction of the slave and at the best height to be 

picked up. The cheaper varities of the same articles are always &quot;behind&quot; the

march direction of the slave, and/or a little too low or a little to high.<BR>

Now stop and have a look at the varieties of a given product, say whisky, or 

honey (not wodka, it's not necessary, you should always and only drink 

 Moskowskaja :=)<BR>

Humans (euroamericans) stroll with the eyes from left to right (like you are 

 doing now, reading my lines), therefore notice how the CHEAPEST varities 

 of a given product are on the left, the more expensive on 

 the right, in the hope 

 that slave's hands will be quicker as slave's brain (as it's often the case 

 nowadays).<BR><BR>

<B>Funny, the fridges open all in a weird sense</B><BR>

Yeah, the doors are made in order to enforce the slave to see immediately 

other products as soon as he closes one. Note the disposition of the 

products inside the ice-boxes on the floor, too... it's far from casual as 

you can see... notice how far away are those products and how easy to pick up

 are these? Goddy! I believe we should drive school classes through the malls 

 explaining all these tricks to the little future slaves!<BR>

<BR>

<B>May I NOT help you?</B><BR>

You'll NEVER hear a supermarket employee asking you &quot;may I help you&quot; in 

normal cases (unless you really and badly need it and you chase him), because that would limit the 

possibility of you buying a lotta other useless products instead of what

 you need, it would break the 

&quot;magic&quot;, and in that dreaded case the slave could 

even come to the nasty idea to lower the blick on the trolley, instead of 

filling it -overwhelmed by soo muuuch choice- with everything he sees.<BR>

Besides the employees are really 

busy &quot;filling&quot; the spaces... it's very important that the products are 

positionated at a predetermined distance... too many people on to narrow 

space and some slaves would &quot;put back&quot; the product they have in their hands, 

instead of deposing it in the trolley...<BR>

<BR>

<B>What are stoppers?</B><BR>

Stoppers are the &quot;dynamic&quot; part of a supermarket... most of the slaves come 

here twice in a week (at least) and do not want to see always the same things 

in the same places (they could come to the -right- conclusion that they 

are being drilled to buy) even if they at the same time want to be 

reassured... &quot;I know where's the wine&quot;. Everything must stay where it was, 

but a part must move... hence the stoppers, little mountains of &quot;offers&quot;, 

toilet paper to-day, shampoos to-morrow.<BR>

<BR>

<B>Cry baby cry</B>

There are queues at the cashier, and that's the right moment to bite the

 slave's kids, which are terribly annojed and exige the products that have 

been 

purposely put on the two sides of the cashier queue. Watch them, look at

their prices... very very interesting this is

really the &quot;lower instinct&quot; part: All these articles are chosen and

calculated to give maximum profit, all products you would NEVER in your life 

come to buy but here, coz this is the only real (compelled) 

&quot;canyon&quot; that the slave must cross... &quot;Dad, may I have this 

and that?&quot;. &quot;Why shouldn't I buy those nice mints?&quot;<BR>

Notice how these products are MUCH more expensive than the 

&quot;three for one&quot; confections of the same product that are sold inside the 

shop somewhere... but where? You will not know, coz that's exactly the 

sort of products you normally don't buy! How many time do I have to 

prove it to you<BR> Teach 

your kid to use the waiting time to completely upset the order of 

these products, or do it yourself. These shelfs can also be very useful 

to dump all useless products that you did buy without noticing ever after 

having read this... best of all is to dump there a couple of frozen 

icecreams boxes upside down, they will slowly leak everything on so 

artfully positioned peppermints :=)<BR>

<BR>

<B>D'you want our &quot;superadvantage&quot; nice plastic card?</B>

<BR>No! No! No! It's only a cheap, dirty trick to gather all possible data 

on your 

comportament whithout ever having to raise a finger. They'll know how much 

and when and where you drink/shit/eat/

love/cry/wash/sleep/etc and stuff their databases for free (notice how the 

&quot;discounts&quot; are lilliputian in comparison with what they steal you through 

the abovementioned tricks... did you know that 35% of the fridge products 

you buy will go directly from fridge to dustbin? That's the real average,

 duh)<BR>

<BR>

So let's battle against them! Codebar! Understand! Explain others! Free the 

stupid slaves... watch the world around you free from petty convention and 

understand in what for an awful mess you are condemned to live!

An addition, by Michel (slightly edited by fravia+):<PRE><FONT color="blue">

- Why do they start with fresh fruit? (addendum)

Fresh fruits are fragile.  If you put them in the bottom of your

caddy and then lay heavy conserves on it, it will be a mess...  

So you have to begin with the conserves (near the exit), then 

have to go back to the fruits, then return once more towards the exit.  

Result : you cross shelves three times instead of one !



- The entrance is left

The &quot;counterclockwise&quot; turning is due to the fact that the right leg

is usually stronger... the 90% of the population is right-handed (or

&quot;right-legged&quot; in this case ?).  So it is normal to turn slightly to 

the left.  



Funny, but some shops seem to experiment the opposite: a big european 

furniture shop (IKEA) has choosen for some of its shops (in France for 

instance, yet not elsewhere) a &quot;clockwise direction&quot; layout.  

The idea is probably that in this way you will browse through these 

shops more slowly, instead of choosing the &quot;optimum&quot; -quicker- trajectory.



- &quot;Hypermarket&quot;

I don't know if this concept exists in english.  In french (my native 

language, as you probably have already guessed), it means a big supermarket 

which sells not only food: also clothing, tools, and so on.

In these &quot;hypermarkets&quot;, things are in part different from the supermarkets: 

they have plenty of room, so they can mix the food and the non-food (one

shelf of food, and one shelf of non-food).  So when you have taken -say- 

your usual vodka and you want to get your peanuts, you *will* pass through

the shelf where they sell those magnificents-and-yet-not-so- expensive beer 

glasses...

Moreover at the beginning of the shop there is always a &quot;starter&quot;, with all 

the current &quot;discounts&quot;, and usually also clothes, wine and other completely 

useless gadgets...



- Men and women (non P.C. section ;-)

Usually, women are going to the supermarket.  That's why in the

&quot;hypermarkets&quot; (see above), the clothing is always between the entry

and the food.

But in the last 15 years, with women working more and more, men have 

begun to go shopping, instead of their wives.  Result: in the commercials, 

on your TV you are now brainwashed about &quot;men taking care of themselves&quot;, 

and instead of the good old &quot;AQUA VELVA&quot; and &quot;Eau de Cologne 4711&quot;, which 

were more or less the only things you would have bought (if ever) in the 

pre-enslavement old good times you now have an icredible plethora of 

'parfums pour homme' (note the <U>form</U> of parfums' bottles, btw, which 

as usual has a pavlovian meaning); and not only parfums: have a look: shampoo

&quot;formule homme&quot;,  Gilette Sensor-Excel-Plus-Double-..., and so on!

They realized they have a lot of new potential gullible slaves, and they 

found an easy way to get'em... it's easy to foresee: parfums for kids (already 

started with totthpaste) and for dogs and cats...



- Generalization: slave's surroundings

These concepts are true for the supermarkets.  These last 10 years

in Europa, it has generalized (an idea coming from US, as it is older

there) to what we call &quot;commercial center&quot;: a supermarket is never

alone, you always have other shops around: jewelry, hi-fi shop,

CD/Video shop, deluxe clothing, fashion clothing, low-price clothing,

even cinemas (in english &quot;theaters&quot; ?), *and* the obligatory Quick or

McDonald...



Ok, that's all.  Thanks for reading ;-)  Complete informations on the

subject must exist somewhere, at least in marketing courses, or

perhaps in psychology, I don't know.  Anyway, it's always good 

stuff to know.

<A name="anchortdo"></A>

An addition, by The Dark One (slightly edited by fravia+):

<P><FONT color="blue">

As for small additions i'd like to make to two essays...

<BR><BR>

1. There is +ORC's essay about supermarkets and how they enslave 

you, which mentions the counterclockwise effect. I for myself have 

a small side job in a pathetic attempt to get more 

money to cover my ever growing expenses, and can add to this. 

<BR><BR>

One time in this sports store, I was told to adjust all the lamps on 

the floor i was working on. Naturally, when i was told to give them a 

little tilt to the left while still illuminating the products (make 

everything look nice and shiny and all that), I had to ask why that 

would have any effect. The story behind it was the same 

counterclockwise effect, but added to that the fact that when the 

lamps are tilted that way, it will invite the customer to keep a 

certain direction. walking in normally and taking the 

counterclockwise route, the customer will see light shining on the 

clothing, walking clockwise, he will have light shining somewhat in 

his eyes... at least in his view of vision. Therefore, what will 

happen is that 'the herd' will take the signals in his 

visual range and most likely amble through the store 

counterclockwise, and end up in front of the cash register, or at 

least not disturb other customers as they browse by moving in an 

opposing direction. To mention another aspect of 'herd behaviour', 

people like to 'follow the leader', and when they see people in front 

of them moving through the whole store, instinctively they will 

follow, thinking 'there must be a reason people look through it'. 

<BR><BR>

Another thing perhaps is the way you are supposed to approach 

customers. Unlike what's reported by +ORC in his supermarket essay, 

in a store like mine you are naturally deeply instructed to 'press' 

the customer on whether you can help him or her. 

But you don't ask 'can I help you'. <BR>

Why not? This immediately implies that you are granting favours, that 

you are in a 'master' position vis-a-vis the customer. You are supposed 

to ask the customer 'can I be of service?', or similar questions along 

the same 'Aladdin's lamp' line, obviously giving the customer a false 

sense of having  the upper hand in the conversation, as well as the 

customer/seller relationship.<BR> 

Then the whole verbal selling technique starts, but I guess that is 

beyond the interest of this topic. There are a lot more things to say 

about standing in the kind of store I am in, but I am not sure whether 

this is relevant to the discussion at hand, let alone whether it is of 

major interest. <BR><BR>



I'll quickly mention a few short things I know from other stores, such 

as the fact that the music you hear in stores is <U>naturally</U> always 

programmed. In one of the stores where a colleague of mine once worked  

they even had a rythm added to it, in the sense of numbers being 

played. There would be four 15 minute parts of music, especially 

set to be sort of a subliminal inducer for customers entering at the 

right time. The first part would be sort of a welcoming theme, 

followed by restful lingering, after which you would get a bit 

jazzed up by faster music until the last 15 minutes 'invited' you 

more or less franticly to leave the store again. Most stores work 

with customer counts in order to program store success, where 

the more customers that have visited without buying something, 

the lower the per customer buying amount will be. Another 

interesting point which clarifies obviously why stores usually 

try to herd you out after a certain time; every customer around you 

that doesn't buy anything affects other customers (if they don't buy 

anything, then why should I? this is obviously crap, and so on). 

Lastly, I've heard also from another colleague (it's amazing 

what you can learn if you are willing to infiltrate and search, that's 

what real social engineering for real reversers should be about, btw) 

that in the place she worked in before this one, they worked on 

'sniffing posts'!<BR>

What they had done was place on several locations a couple of hidden 

'deodorisers' (for lack of a better word), which would dispense fragrances 

that would complement the feeling you should have with certain products. 

From what I've gathered, back then it wasn't so successful, but they 

are most probably still working on it; if you smell funny stuff in 

a huge store, you know where it comes from. So, if you do, don't just sit there and say 'Ah ja': Investigate, find 

the truth, report it.

<BR><BR>

Thinking about that, I do remember seeing all kinds of spray cans lately 

in that line of product enhancement. There are cans that I have held in 

my hand that have the 'fresh bakery smell', which can make you think you're 

in a bakery from heaven, and everyone knows by now the 'new car' spraycan 

that is supposed to add that new smell to your car, the smell that you 

only get when you first buy it. Needless to say, fooling people 

means fooling the mind, and fooling the mind is done for a large 

part by fooling the senses. Basically it is so that consumers are treated 

like an heard of stupid cows, that must be lured into buying things they 

don't need in the least for the sake of filling some wallets.

<BR><BR>

2. An observation on the cigarette ads. In our country (The 

Netherlands), if I remember correctly, the European Union's directives 

sort of restrict cigarette companies to blatantly advertise their product. 

Since I do not either buy cigarettes or search for these ads, I do 

not know for sure how those restrictions lie, or how much they are 

enforced. What I do see right now in advertisements shown in 

cinema's and on billboards is the rather funny shift of 'advertising'.

 <BR><BR>

Suddenly, the art of sponsering is discovered, and all these 'events' 

pop up with sigarette brands attached to them. This ranges from 

the 'marlboro flashbacks' (bands covering a favorite group) to 

'barclay's fashion awards', and not to forget the 'drum rythm festival' 

(drum being the stuff that you roll before you smoke). Now that 

they are not allowed to advertise openly neither with 'cowboy scenes' 

(see Martine Joly's splendid <A href="marlbo2.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/marlbo2.htm">essay</A>: Rhetoric 

of advertisement, a "Marlboro Classic" Advertisement analyzed) nor 

stuff like that, they get name recognition by sponsoring these 

events, and naturally make connections with the show involved. Of 

course, the same is being done with beers to some extent, but 

cigarettes right now are the leading players in this game. 

<BR><BR>

With kindest regards, <BR>
