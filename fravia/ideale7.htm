How to seriously annoy smut sites...<BR>How

 to allow any luser to 

access <U>any commercial smut site</U> for free :-)</H2><BR>

The info below is general anonymity lore, available (almost) all

over the Web, yet -no minor deed!- 

the data below have been collected and organized in December, 

under heavy snowfalls, by

Hey! I hope that you are a commercial smut site visitor</B><BR>

I hope that some of the readers that have found this page (that I

sincerely wish to be copied and

spread everywhere on the web :-) are commercial smut site visitors,

because

the main purpose of this specific section is to destroy those sites,

and therefore I believe we have to hit them hard on the only place where 

it will hurt them (on

their

wallets).<BR>I have in the last couple of years conducted a lonely battle against 

commercial smut sites (see <A href="ideale.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideale.htm">General Smut

sites busting</A>), and I have now realized that that very lurid 'commercial' 

logic is -unfortunately- against me: for every site that I have 

successfully destroyed there have appeared ten more on this huge 

(and increasingly useless) web of ours. So I'm changing tactic, 

and I'm doing it right now.<BR> I'll continue 

to deliver commercial 

smut site "busting knowledge"

for the pleasure of myself and few other 'enlightened' ones, but I'll start -right now- to deliver 

commercial smut site "ruining knowledge" for the masses, 

in order to gain the great final battle for a free -not commercial- web.<BR>

Therefore in the never lost hope of being able to destroy all 

those obnoxious commercial smut sites

that are polluting the web I would like to give any reader the possibility of accessing

commercial sites

for

free using all the tricks I know of (I repeat that I have NOTHING against nude images, if given 

away for free, I'm against people polluting our web in order 

to scrap some money exploiting slaves instead of freeing them... 

I'm not a 'puritan' censor: I'm just against all commercially oriented bastards). 

<BR><BR><B>Take note...</B> 

<BR>&lt;<FONT color=purple>legal 

backcovering on</FONT>&gt;<BR>

"<I>I would like</I>", that's what I wrote above... c'mon, that's obviously just a

<B>wish</B> of mine. I'm not saying that anyone should do something

illegal

really, because in that case (which is not <U>this</U> case) the content of

this

very page you are reading -My Gott- could be deemed illegal (by some contorted legal minds, 

in some countries, under

determinate circumstances)

if used with malice. The following information is only given

as "general anonymity knowledge" and as "commercial smut sites

busting

knowledge" for educational purposes. It is just <B>web-lore</B>! (As such available 

on all relevant usenet groups). The idea is

that

you (potential site

ruiner) may

understand what COULD happen (which is an important knowledge <I>per

se</I>:

why should you

be denied the awareness of these

techniques?).<BR> Of course, <I>cela va sans dire</I>, I 

never attacked myself any site with this kind of 'low level' approaches (in fact 

I would eventually use much harder ones :-) Moreover I do

not condone these approaches in the least... or at least not very much.

<BR>&lt;<FONT color=purple>legal 

backcovering off</FONT>&gt;

<BR><BR>

<B>Let's begin</B>

<BR>First off, I suggest you browse  either using Netscape or using Opera.

I will  not give you here any instruction pertaining to M$IE browsers,

for the simple reason that I don't like

Micro$oft and I don't like the people using their products.<BR><BR>

<B>First thing to do, is to keep a

low

profile while surfing the web.</B><BR>

The first thing to do is to

eliminate any tracking possibility based on your cookies.

<BR>

If you use the web a lot, then you probably have

collected several cookies on your hard disc without realizing it,

see my <A href="noanon.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/noanon.htm">anonymity</A> section.

<BR>

Cookies are information snippets stored in your harddisk when you visit

a site, designed and useful FOR THE SITE you visited<BR>

A Cookie is a little nugget of information that is sent to your

browser from a World Wide Web Server. This block of data can

be anything, a unique user ID generated by the server, the current

date and time, the IP Address of where the browser is

logged onto the net or any other chunk of data that you want. <BR>



After a browser receives a cookie it will then send that cookie

(nugget of info) to the server that set it whenever it requests an

html page. The browser will only send the cookie to the server that

originally set it. This means that I (at my server)

can't tell if you (some browser) have cookies that other sites have

set. In other words I can't steal cookies I haven't given you

by using HTTP protocols. Yet my cookies can be nasty enough to protect 

my site from people that are not accessing it through the PATH I want them 

to do it (which is the case for most smut servers).<BR>





Basically, then, cookies are small pieces of information that are

sent automatically from a server to your computer.

They are stored on your hard disc, where they act as labels,

showing that you have visited a particular page. If the

user goes back and visits the same website at a later date, the web

server will detect the presence of one of its cookies on the

users computer, and can stuff its databases and eventually modify

the page accordingly. Ever wondered how does Yahoo mail recognize

you when you login?

<BR><BR>

So you definitely want to silent cookies.  To shut them off, see the

instructions on my <A href="anon.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/anon.htm">anonimity page</A>: basically



Then, second step, avoid Java and Javascript. As you'll be able to

learn

on my dedicated <A href="javascri/index.html" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/javascri/index.html">javascript</A> pages, you can do

almost

anything with a good script, among other things you can get a <A

href="emasnat.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/emasnat.htm">readers address</A>!

<BR>

 Once a site grabs your email address (if you'r not using a chain of

pseudos),

all they have to do is to run is a simple e-mail check through a place like

Yahoo and they can find out where you get your internet service from,

where you live, your name and home phone number.

<BR><BR>

Ok, next you need a way to get into these pay sites. Since they are "pay" sites (duh) they 

will want money from you. And that is their weakest point :-)<BR>

So you will need

to download a credit card generator. There are hundreds of these little 

programs, which will

create valid credit card numbers for you to "use" at 

the commercial smut pay sites.<BR>Since for obvious reasons there is NO 

possibility to check immediately a credit card number (else anyone could 

easily bruteforce such a database until they would get valid numbers), and 

since, for obvious reasons as well, the 'clients' of the smut sites want to 

drool immediately over their images...

<HR><I>OK, of course anyone that pays in order to access a commercial smut 

site is just a plain stupid luser... of course there's 

NO NEED WHATSOEVER to pay for something on the web... anyone can have 

tons of <U>backdoors</U> for free, immediately, just performing on good old Hotbot (or any other 

<A href="howtosea.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howtosea.htm">search engine</A> with similar algos) a query like 

<BR><BR><CENTER></I>

<FONT color=blue>+"index of" +bond -james +jpg</FONT>

</CENTER><BR><I> ...and substitute '<FONT color=blue>bond</FONT>' with what your 

more or less excited fantasy craves... 

but we are trying here to get morons, not accomplished searchers, 

to ruin those sites... and educate those very morons at the same time</I> :-)<HR>

...they will accept the faked credit card number, they will give you access, 

and you will be able to roam around their sites 'eventually gaining root :-) 

until they realize that you've had them. At that moment they will delete 

your account, usually between 10 to 40 days after you have signed (at least a week). 

If you need a credit card numbers app, just query 

+"credit card generators" in any good search engine, you'll find a dozen dozens.

<BR><BR><B>

Hide your location

</B><BR>

Now that you have found the simple tools you need to fake a credit card 

number, just wait a minute: before you use them you

will need to hide your "identity" on the net.<BR>This is

 the most time comsuming part and at the same time the more useful part of the whole 

attack scheme.<BR>

Many use the service of Anonymizer (<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.anonymizer.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.anonymizer.com/'" tppabs="http://www.anonymizer.com/">http://www.anonymizer.com</A>) 

to keep from being traced, but unfortunately anonymizer itself logs all

visits in order to see where your going (because THOSE data are the wealth for the anonymizer guys... 

just like your supermarket's 'special frequent buyer' card will let them know how much you 

cry ~ shit ~ make love with your beloved one so the anonymizer and ALL search engines 

are free just in order to GATHER DATA on you... never forget this simple truth)

<BR><BR>

Therefore, instead of the Anonymizer, you can use something that works samo samo, but 

won't log.<BR>It is a very simple device (duh) called a <FONT color=red>proxy 

server</FONT>. Basically it is just a

firewall of sorts, that makes it seem as if you are living and getting 

your

internet from somewhere else.

<BR>This is how it works:<CENTER>

Surfing Normally<BR>                                   

your account > access > commercial smut site<BR>                              

your account &lt; send data &lt; commercial smut site</PRE>

</CENTER>

That's how it happens when you surf the usual way. You bustthe site

and they can see what your IP was, and eventually trace you back, and eventually *

contact

your ISP, and eventually you're in trouble (not easy if you chain pseudos, but, hey, why should 

you risk anything?).<BR>When you use a proxy server, they

will think you live somewhere like  South Korea, even if you live in Luxembourg. 

<BR>This is how a proxy server works:

<CENTER>

Surfing with a Proxy Server<BR>                  

your account > access > proxy server > access > commercial smut site<BR>

your account &lt; send data &lt; proxy server &lt; send data &lt; commercial smut site

</CENTER><BR>

So what you are doing is logging into a proxy server from your ISP

account. Now, if the proxy server you find doesn't care about who

you are, then you go to a commercial site you want to explore ~ bust ~ destroy ~ whatever 

you fancy.<BR>Since you live -say- in Luxembourg, the

commercial smut site would normally see that you live there, and try to retaliate.<BR>

Yet, let us

say your using a proxy server you found somewhere in  South Korea or in some other 

middle of nowhere where they don't understand anything about this stuff... 

The commercial smut site sends 

all its data (read: lusers' images) to the proxy server in  South Korea, while the 

proxy sends

the data to you. The commercial smut site just figures that you are some 

horny luser from  South Korea! But what happens when your target site finds out that

your using a fake credit card number?  They just notice that someone from

 South Korea signed up. Then they figure out it was a proxy and

anybody could have done it. They also don't want to waste time on a not very expensive 

account.

<BR><BR>

Now that you know about proxys, you need to find your arrows. Finding a proxy

is easy, the time consuming part is finding a good one. You

can find proxys on the search engines by typing in keywords like

"public proxys" or "free proxys", or you can perform a research on the relevant usenet 

channels to find all the proxys you'll need for the next one thousand years.

<BR><BR>

Once you find a promising one, do the following:<BR>

either<BR>

<UL><LI>

     -go to the top of the page of Netscape and click on Option

   </LI><LI>-choose "Network preferences"

  </LI><LI>-pick "proxies"

 </LI><LI>-click on "manual proxy configuration"

          </LI><LI>-then click on "view"

          </LI><LI>-where it says: "http" put in the proxy server ( ie:

proxy.inter.net)

          </LI><LI>-under "port" enter in the port number (ie: 8080)

          </LI><LI>-click "ok"

</LI></UL>

or

          -go to the top of the page of Netscape and click on edit

          </LI><LI>-choose "preferences"

          </LI><LI>-pick "advanced"

          </LI><LI>-pick  "proxies"

          </LI><LI>-click on "manual proxy configuration"

          </LI><LI>-then click on "view"

          </LI><LI>-under "port" enter in the port number (ie: 8080)

          </LI><LI>-click "ok"

</LI><UL>

<BR>



For Opera's browsers, here is what <B><U>Mhead</U></B> wrote recently:

<FONT color=purple><PRE>

As promised, I have done research and have uncovered some very interesting

things I believe those using Opera, specifically 3.50, should know.



Preferences-&gt;Advanced:



	This is where the Cookie logging option is. As you said about Netscape,

this should be disabled.



	Another interesting thing here is Referrer Logging. This option allows

those monitoring a given site to see where you came from, and quite

possibly where your going. This is a definite uncheck.





Preferences-&gt;Multimedia:



Here resides if Javascripting is enabled. Don't see Javascript? It's

under scripting languages. Unchecking this box takes out javascript. Why is

this important? The best way to keep yourself safe from javascript bombs is

to not enable it in the first place. Kinda like having a mine sniffer.

Remember where this is, just in case you DO need javascripting enabled

for certain pages.



Preferences-&gt;Link Presentation:



For the true paranoids, set both non-visited and visited links to the

same color, and the same format (underlined, bold, ect.)



A nasty trick that I have not come across, but I can imagine, is someone

setting their page refresh rate to gather information. An option here,

Enable Document Loading, when unchecked, prevents this.



If you have any question about whether your preferences are giving away

anything about you that you DON'T want, check out your Opera.ini.



Also, unless moved, Opera's cache is located at c:\opera\cache

<BR><BR>

          M$IE users will have to figure out these hints on their own :-P<BR>

Once you have the proxy installed, you have to find out if it is a

good one or not. You will need to go to

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi'" tppabs="http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi">http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi</A>, 

for instance. If that bot will say "<FONT color=purple>proxy server detected</FONT>"

that means that they're keeping track of your IP nevertheless, and that

means you <U>may</U> get detected. Play it on the winning side: time to find a 

new proxy! Once you get a

proxy that says "<FONT color=purple>proxy server not detected</FONT>" visiting 

the above <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi'" tppabs="http://www.tamos.com/bin/proxy.cgi">link</A>, 

you will know you have found a useful proxy.<BR>Just to be

certain check it once more! For instance visit the Anonymizer's snoop page at:

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.anonymizer.com/snoop.cgi  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.anonymizer.com/snoop.cgi'" tppabs="http://www.anonymizer.com/snoop.cgi">http://www.anonymizer.com/snoop.cgi</A> 

and see what they say. 

<BR><BR>

Now go ahead! Sign up for commercial smut sites with a fake credit card 

number that you got from one of the many generator programs... and stay

anonymous! Have fun with it, and just imagine what else you could

do... moreover faking credit card numbers is NOT always necessary, since you 

can, easily have as many "true ones" as you need... Many reversers just 

pick up receipts from parking lots, from mall

floors, from air-lounges ('first class' duty free shops are a <U>incredible 

Bonanza</U> for anyone 

that just happens to have a little visual memory :-) and then use 

the credit card numbers on those receipts on the lines explained above. Of course 

 I'm only joking, I'm just paradoxically speaking, the above approaches would be, I'm afraid, 

quite illegal in most countries of the "real" world... in 

the real world you should NOT annoy these advertisement spammers, you 

should never do it, &#191comprehendes?, even for a good cause like getting rid of those 

awfully stupid commercial smut sites :-)
