<FONT color=gray><H2>

An introduction to web-searching<BR>(Websearching, the sublime art)</H2></FONT>

</CENTER>

I see it coming... in a few years (actually already now, even if most zombies 

establishments have 

not yet realized it) one of the most important jobs will be, of course, websearcher. 

<BR>



We'll have many specialized branches: web-searchers, web-stalkers, web-seekers and so on. Zen and 'feeling' as

well as a very broad 'global' knwoledge will be required. 

<BR>

It's a good anthidot to the hyperspecialisation that has nearly brought the whole 

silly commercial oriented society we are compelled to live in into a well deserved 

dead end: only large-minded, capable searchers will be able to keep the 'larger' 

over-perspective, and will be able to 

find ANYTHING they need (for free, of course), from Vivaldi's Concerto n.7 in F for four 

violins and cello 

(it's on the Web) through the second edition of the <I>Police Criminelle, Technique 

et Tactique</I> (it's on the Web) to <I>A Western Australian survival kit for writing English</I> (it's 

on the Web).<BR> For the first time in the history of humanity it DOES NOT MATTER ANYMORE (for knowledge purposes) 

if you are located in a big rich city with huge 

libraries and universities or if you happen 

to live in the middle of nowhere or in a very poor country!<BR>

EVERYTHING is on the Web for free! I mean: <U>any</U> book, <U>any</U> newspaper, <U>any</U> university 

paper and <U>any</U> image, moreover (soon) 

<U>any</U> sound, <U>any</U> 

music!<BR>This means that (albeit amidst 

mountains of useless garbage) <U>ALL KNOWLEDGE</U> is on the Web, for free, 

for you to discover and enjoy!<BR>If you don't believe it, just learn how to search!<BR><BR>

<UL>

<LI>A 

<B>good searcher</B> is the kind of guy that can gather 

in a couple of hours all

the material you need to write that nasty University Paper it would have took you 

at least three 

months to complete!<BR>

<LI>A <B>good searcher</B> is the kind of guy that -given half a dozen computers and stable 

internet access- can solve any librarian problem for any  (and wherever located!) 

middle sized town!<BR>

<LI>A <B>good searcher</B> is the kind of guy YOU will need very oft and very badly -that is, 

unless you learn the sublime art of searching yourself... and that's the purpose of this section of 

my site: a small contribution to the next generation of wizard searchers :-)

<BR></UL>

<BR>You'll gain here knowledge that is very 'handy', as you will see, and 

that you will not easily 

find elsewhere, even if 

I have noticed that many "universities zombies" have already begonnen to use (not to 

spread, <U>to use</U>, a subtle yet significant difference :-) the 

techniques that we have invented and published on this site, giving very 

seldom -how characteristic of university "habitat" and mentality!- any sign of 

recognition of our work :-(<BR><BR>Anyway, I'm sure that the importance of this section 

will be more and more clear with the development of the Web (or at least of the 

'sound' and neither commercialized nor brainwashed part of it :-)<BR>

This is a 'living' workshop, of course, that will florish gathering 

more and more additions from all the 

great wizard searchers among my readers (and beyond, since "real" wizard searchers will 

obviously find this section all by themselves :-)<BR>Hope to hear from you, 

and to receive contributions, from many searchers. Remember: the whole thing works 

only if we build on the shoulders of others and if others build on our ones... if you 

just leech, you loose and we loose! (that's incidentally the reason I have started with my last lesson to 

produce 'light' public versions and 'heavy' versions for contributors :-(<BR><HR><CENTER><TABLE border=1><TR><TD bgcolor= "#4FEEF4">

<HR size=3><FONT color=gray><FONT size=+3>Robin Hood's lessons</FONT></FONT><BR>

Well, from the dark webwoods of Sherwood, all of a sudden, Robin Hood has 

sent me three 'promising' 

<FONT color=blue>how to search</FONT> lessons that you should by all means read (and head). 

I'm very happy that good 

searchers start to contribute to this section, and hope that many other searchers and 

stalkers will add their own findings. 

 In fact effectively web searching means to 

master techniques that are far from obvious and that anyone 

seriously intentioned in reversing should master. So I'm very happy to host here these 

"how to search" <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red><A href="robinsta.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/robinsta.htm">lessons and stratagems</A> by Robin hood. 

<BR>

In fact, believe it or not,  on 

the Web ther are some 'rangers' like in Tollkien's books, people that are neither 

proper hackers nor crackers, 

but that know how to fetch what they want, if needs be. Robin Hood seems to be 

one of them and I'm glad that he decided to start helping us.

<BR>

Enjoy!

<HR size=3><FONT color=gray><FONT size=+3>Surreal5's lessons</FONT></FONT><BR>

Well, Surreal5's lessons (and his introduction) that you'll find 

<IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red>

"<A href="surrsea1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/surrsea1.htm">here</A>", are IMO more important 

for the approaches and the techniques they deal with than for their 

specific subjects (basically how to find warez).  

Nevertheless, since warez ARE on the web (much too much, IMO) why shouldn't you 

learn how to find them?<BR>This is what Surreal5 wrote:<FONT color=purple><PRE>I've tried to organise this (provisorial) essay so, that both beginners and

advanced users can get something out of each lesson, and can almost

directly use it. Even if you are already an expert on how to find the

example types i used, you may get something out of it, a different

perspective, something you hadn't thought of. I like Robin Hoods tutorial,

he has a broader experience than i do, but i feel my lessons give faster

results, with less effort spent on learning boolean ,and other tool

specifics. Consider this a crash course if you will. Consider it a

preliminary to Robin Hoods tutorial. Consider it an alternative view from a

lazy guy who wants results fast ;)</PRE></FONT>Methodolgically ('<U>Net</U>hodologically'? :-) 

Surreal5's documents are

very important essays. I have tried myself some of his tips... for instance, 

if you need 

to navigate and find goodies inside huge 'messy' sites (like mine :-) 

you just add/update the relevant starting urls to a couple of quick 

(and reliable) search engines and 

let their robots do all the work for you! Alternatively, I may add, I found the 

service of those little search robots like the <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://freefind.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://freefind.com/'" tppabs="http://freefind.com/">freefind</A> or 

<A

href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.wired-worker.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.wired-worker.com/'" tppabs="http://www.wired-worker.com/">wired-worker</A>'s bots quite useful for searching 

purpose on sites that don't even need to know you have indicized them completely :-)<BR>

Enjoy!<BR>

<HR size=3><FONT color=gray><FONT size=+3>Cassandra's search engines</FONT></FONT><BR>

No good 'how to search' section would make any sense without some good 

'homemade' search engines... of course you can always learn how to use better the 

main ones, for instance on my own  <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" 

HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red><A href="searengi.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/searengi.htm" >search</A> <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" 

HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red><A href="sealight.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/sealight.htm" >engines</A> pages, yet 

there is another interesting solution by Cassandra, here it is:<BR><BR>

Here you have Cassandra's <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" 

HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red><A href="stalker.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/stalker.htm">stalker</A><BR>

and here you have Cassandra's <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" 

HEIGHT=13 WIDTH=13 ALT= red><A href="fetch_de.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/fetch_de.htm">fetcher</A><BR>

<BR>

<FONT size=+2>They are still in a experimental phase, so bear with us 

and let's hope that cassandra will send some updates</FONT><BR>

<BR>

This is what Cassandra wrote to me:<PRE>

I have divided my work in two parts : the <FONT color=blue>Fetcher</FONT> and the <FONT color=blue>Stalker</FONT>. 

The Fetcher provides an easy-to-use access to various search engines:

  Altavista, Yahoo, HotBot, Lycos, Infoseek, webcrawler, Dogpile, FTP

search, ASK SINA (an ftpsearch-like with a database containing records of

germany sites, mostly), Northern Light Search (recommanded by US army,

although it's not supposed to mean anything), Goto (formerly WWW Worm).



The stalker provides gateways to finger and whois, along with the 'dejanews

search filter' without all the ugly grafix. It's not really developped, for

stalking matter is related to the country your prey lives in.



btw, Fetcher uses frames (yes, frames!), but in a clever way : you'r never

jailed in a small portion of your browser window. If used sparingly, frames

can be useful.



Of couse, each one might grow with engines or stalking services. But i'll

develop it only if you or someone else you could give it to is interested

and find it worth growing.</PRE>Well, I hope that this 'search engines' form 

approach will be developed too. I'm sure my readers will immediately 

understand the practicality and the convenience of having 

some single, well tuned, search engine forms, without having to use the 

awful commercial entrances, delayed by all the crap advertisement they put on 

(as if they would not gather enough money and power just LOOKING at what 

people search :-(<BR>
