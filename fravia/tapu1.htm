One thing is sure: I don't need to present to my readers Tapu. I may exaggerate, but I 

believe that there is noone on the web that has even vaguely to do with reverse engineering 

who hasn't visited Tapu's beautiful <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.surf.to/tapu/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.surf.to/tapu/'" tppabs="http://www.surf.to/tapu/">site</A>. <BR>

I'm glad to publish this small essay, even if there are 

some (few) points where I don't agree with Tapu (Tapu is so perfectly and 

deeply 'holy' that -for instance-  chooses 

to ignore the considerable differences that do exist 

between warez-crackers and anti-warez crackers: I, for instance, wouldn't give 

any patch to LaMR2365@aol.com... even if I would gladly give  all 

the help needed to reverse any target :-)<BR>

Yet she's right: knowledge is that what really matters for all crackers alike, 

and crackers (all crackers), 

are, as you 

may recall, "<FONT color=purple>heirs of an almost extinct race of researchers that has nothing in common with the television slaves and the publicity and trend zombies around us. Cracker should always be capable of going beyond the obvious, seek knowledge where others do not see and do not venture</FONT>" 

(paste "heirs of an almost extinct race of researchers" with <FONT color=red>"</FONT>, inside altavista and you'll see where I have 

taken it from :-), moreover, in this curious web-age,  

maybe for the first time in history, knowledge, 'real' knowledge is <I>de facto</I> freely available, without (almost) 

any filter at all. It had never 

happened before, and this may (may) change the world (would be about time!).<BR> 

Head this 'cracking related' reality cracking. That there is an 'information 

deprivation' strategy is a deep truth. The society where we live is already -clearly- 

structured in a "two-tiered system of haves and have nots", and reversing, as a practice and 

as a philosophy, is indeed a 

pain in the neck for all parasites and paid lackeys of this awful society of vulgar slavemasters and 

gullible slaves... Read and enjoy! Let's hope that Tapu will use more often her pen to 

show us what we are and where we are (or should be) going!

<B>Cracking The Information Curtain</B><BR><BR>



by Tapu, 30 October 1998

<BR><BR></CENTER>

Information is power. Armed with that truism, humans have endeavored,

since

the beginning of time, to withhold information from each other,

typically

in a group from group format.

<BR>Almost every corner of the earth, at one time or another discouraged or

forbade the education of women. When European &quot;colonists&quot;

invaded

the Americas and established race-based slavery, education of slaves was

criminalized; the scars and after-effects of this are still present in

many

parts of the U.S. and Latin America.<BR><BR>



While race/religion/sex-based information deprivation still far from

extinct, in a general sense, we are moving forward toward a two-tiered

rainbow system of haves and have nots, based more on economics than

genetics, and while it is unquestionably more difficult for, to use an

example,  a woman of color in the U.S to accumulate enough assets to

move

her up into the heady realms of the haves, once she is there, the

previous

&quot;disadvantages&quot; of being a woman of color magically

disappear.<BR><BR>



As the media is so fond of telling us, we have now moved from the Stone

Age

to the Information Age, and Information is rapidly becoming the ticket

to

punch. The quaintly named &quot;Information Superhighway&quot; itself

has

punched a large hole in the Formal Education Scam, whereby economic gain

could be neatly filtered away from the masses and into the cups of those

few who had the resources to pay for impressive sounding diplomas from

prestigious institutions, whether they had learned, or had the capacity

to

learn anything or not.<BR><BR>



Today, it does not matter so much if you have three degrees in Ancient

History from Harvard. When HugeCo, Inc. has an urgent need for Oracle

database programmers, and will gladly pay one $150 an hour, the

pertinent

question is whether the candidate can program. Note the period at the

end

of that sentence.<BR><BR>



This condition means that Information Deprivation strategies must

change.

It is no longer sufficient to ensure, through politics, that the poor

will

have such woefully inadequate elementary educations that they will have

little or no chance of developing the kinds of standardized test-taking

skills to pass University entrance exams, even if scholarship money can

be

found. If they can get to a computer, they can educate themselves, in

areas

of knowledge that the vast majority of politicians know nothing

about.<BR><BR>



Although the politicians, and many Giants of Industry, see these matters

through a glass darkly, if at all, they are aware of the danger here.

They

can see the slow but sure carmelization of the West, turning on the

immutable laws of Mendel and Math, and they must act.<BR><BR>



First of all, filtering software. If, they reason, they can limit, on

one

lofty-sounding pretext or other, the information to which the masses

have

access, particularly in the formative school-age years, they can nip

this

thing in the bud. A child who enters url after url, only to be hit each

time, with a colorful popup telling her or him to choose another site,

will

soon lose interest.<BR><BR>



Second, and just as important, is keeping software programs

inaccessible.

A person lacking in means and future opportunity, seeking to better

their

condition, will not get very far if their self-education is limited to

freeware and trial periods of the software commonly used in most

businesses.<BR><BR>



Software companies, for the most part, are exceptionally cooperative in

this endeavor, writing ever larger, more system-resource-consuming

behemoths, so that only those with the latest, newest, fastest machines

can

even run the program at all, even if they are able to acquire it, and

that

is only the beginning.<BR><BR>



Obviously, even if you have managed to gain access to a machine capable

of

running it, if you do not possess $700 of disposable income, you will be

unable to purchase Adobe Photoshop, a basic tool that anyone who

aspires to

have even the most humble Web Development/Graphics job must know inside

and

out. And even if you FOUND $700 in the street, and bought Photoshop, and

subsequently discovered that it did not meet your needs for whatever

reason, you could not return it for a refund, or even credit, as you

could

if it were a microwave or a flannel shirt.<BR><BR>



Making the program extremely large ensures that acquiring it through

alternative distribution channels will be a cumbersome, time-consuming

process, a process which is in addition, courtesy of the politicians and

software companies, criminalized.<BR><BR>



It is worth pointing out here that Adobe, could, if they wanted to, do

any

number of programmatic things to ensure that an alternatively

distributed

copy of Photoshop would not run. But they choose not to. They choose

not to

because they KNOW that if you get it, run it, learn it, and become

employed, you will in all probability cause your new boss to purchase

several licenses for Photoshop.<BR><BR>



There are  many different flavors of copy protection. Some are

&quot;good,&quot; in the sense that they are difficult, almost

impossible

to defeat. Others are cake, and it is the cake that is used by the vast

majority of software manufacturers. Why? Is the &quot;good&quot; copy

protection so much more expensive? No. See above. With one hand, they

distribute programs that are so easy to crack that an evaluation aid

appears on the same day that the program is released. With the other

hand,

they fund the campaigns of  politicians who pass laws criminalizing that

same evaluation aid.<BR><BR>



In this bubbling cesspool of criminalization of self-education and

information deprivation fueled by the light of the Holy Grail of

maintaining an economic oligarchy at all costs, there are, however,

beacons

of goodness. <BR><BR>



I was privileged, as were many of you during its Golden Days before the

arrival of the jack-booted thugs of EFNet, to spend time in #PC98.  I do

not believe that had I stood with Mother Teresa in her Calcutta hospice,

that I would have seen a purer example of selfless, unconditional

dedication to giving to the &quot;poorest of the poor.&quot;<BR><BR>





Just as Harriet Tubman and her ilk sheltered and helped

&quot;runaway&quot;

slaves on their way to freedom in another century, just as Miguel

Hidalgo

raised the banner of the Virgen of Guadalupe and gave the grito that

freed

Mexico from the oppression of Spain,  as prison-scarred Nelson Mandela

led

South Africa out of the darkness of apartheid, so today do Fravia+,

+Greythorne, good wizard Saltine, tKC, Nitallica and all the other Phrozens too

numerous

to mention, Glen Roberts of Nurse Your Net Nanny fame, UCF, tireless

Leonardo, Marek of Astalvista, poopzy, the sometimes nameless but always

brave couriers, the crackers, the compilers, spend their own resources

and

risk their own freedom in the name of What is Right. <BR><BR>



It is they who know that <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=LaMR2365@aol.com&YY=8268  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=LaMR2365@aol.com&YY=8268'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/py/nfCmp.py-Pyt=Tnf&1st=1&to=LaMR2365@aol.com&YY=8268">LaMR2365@aol.com</A> may be asking for the 3dSMax

patch for some superficial or even no reason, but they also know that

unless he has the patch, neither he nor they, nor their children will

reap

the benefits that MAY come from him having it. <BR><BR>



They and all who toil with them in the endless task of tearing down the

Information Curtain are the Heroes, the Saints, the Freedom Fighters of

this Information Age. And, with uncharacteristic optimism, I believe

that

history will bear me out and record them as such.
