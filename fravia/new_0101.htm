        <P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">So what

all this 

          is about? Its about Hacking? Don't know i think its <BR>

          about searching the Net.</FONT></P>

        <P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS"> I'll

agree at 

          this point (and many others) with Fravia+ who says in one of his

pages that you can find everything on a computer near you (or not) on

internet.

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I have an example of 

  searching effectively the net from my personal experience and it is good to 

  share <BR>

  it with you HCUkers. Somebody asked to find some computers with the PHF

exploit. 

  <BR>

  I wanted to test it and see how it works and decide to help him. For you

who 

  don't know nothing about it <BR>

  DON'T LET me explain, just make a search for it through regular search

engines 

  (use your favorite which in my <BR>

  opinion must support boolean searches) or Search in Fravia+ pages to find

out 

  about it. <BR>

  If you don't know how, i must insist: learn how to use the most 

important search engines first, come to the cracking/hacking/whatever stuff later :-)</FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">I did it once with

his 

  site (sorry). Here is the story. I was searching to find something (not

remember 

  now) <BR>

  and i was sure that i had read something about this on Fravia's labyrinth

of 

  pages. <BR>

  I did a search with altavista (my favorite) adding the keyword

host:www.fravia.org 

  and i add<BR>

  </FONT><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">next the string i was

searching 

  for. What this means is that i asked <FONT color=blue>from a main search 

Engine</FONT> <BR>

  to search only <FONT color=blue> inside a specific host</FONT> for the string i was looking for. <BR>

  Unfortunately my search did'nt fish nothing at all. What do you do then in such cases? 

Quit? NO.

<BR>

  Just go to engine's add URL, and add the pages you are interesting to. <BR>

  After one or two days max perform once more the same search and you'll 

have your results. <BR>

  (You see fravia+'s laziness sometimes is good because you have to find new ways

to get your job done :-).</FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">Ok. Ok. For you

who are 

  lazy enough try simple nomad's www hack faq. (www.nmrc.org)</FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">OOPS! Back to our

subject. 

  The phf exploit. I tried 5 or 6 URL's with no result, because it is a too <BR>

  old exploit and many servers (by all means not all :-) have fixed it already... 

then i realized it was boring to 

  do this and i didn't want to get caught, since my IP address will be on numerus

log files on target's computer. But wait a minute... aren't machines born to

serve us?</FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">So i thought

(since i 



  was looking for a file) i could do an ftp search and see what i'll come

up with. 

  <BR>

  Try it go to http://ftpsearch.ntnu.no (serach again! Fravia+ pages to see

other 

  URLs of this search engine. many thanxs to Robin Hood+) and make a search in 

  phf. When you study the results you begin

  thinking. </FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">1. all these servers 

  or some of them maybe have the magical file installed!</FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2" face="Comic Sans MS">2.- most ftp servers 

  are installed in the same machines with http servers and therefore they

have 

  the <BR>

  same name with a little difference we MUST change the ftp portion of the

name 

  with www.</FONT></P>

</FONT></B></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">We can see that one

of the 

  engines answers was <FONT color="#009933">ftp.cs.yale.edu

/usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/phf</FONT>. 

  Hmmm maybe we can fish out something if we try it, because of the edu

URL. They 

  don't dig it too much. Lets try the www location.</FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I gave the command to

my 

  Netscape browser <FONT color="#3366FF">http://www.cs.yale.edu/ </FONT>and i 

  came up with a Yale Univercity screen.<BR>

  Oh! Noo. I read: Yale Univercity Computer science department. They probably 

  have fix it but since we came that far lets give it a try.</FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">I gave the command to

my 

  Netscape browser <FONT

color="#3366FF">http://www.cs.yale.edu/cgi-bin/phf?Qalias=x%0als<BR>

  </FONT> And here is the surprise!!. Their server was very kind and friendly 

  to answer my question. Here is its answer:<BR>

<FONT face="Comic Sans MS" size="2">What does it means? Imagine! The

current directory listing. Of course we can give many more commands like

Fravia's <BR>rm /*<BR>Which I DO NOT recommand! Anyway I told you to check 

out fravia+'s pages... Try it on stupid servers if you can get them... 

But please DON'T damage the

targets above. It would be very stupid and very easyly fixed by the server's administrators 

once you do it. So leave the servers above undisturbed, so 

that other readers, reading this essay can check them out.</FONT></PRE>

  <P><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">3.- Back to our thinking

job. 

    Maybe we can do the same think with a web search. My favorite is digital. 

    <BR>

    Since we want as he (my friend) said edu domain because they have the

most 

    possibilities to have it installed, <BR>

    we give the command <FONT color="#0066CC">domain:edu </FONT>and the

engine 

    will search only that domain </FONT> </FONT></P>

</DIV>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">4.- Shoot

http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?<BR>



pg=q&what=web&kl=XX&q=domain%3Aedu+%2Bcgi-bin+%2Bphf&search.x=21&search.y=12

<BR>

  </FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">5. Begin

search 

  and you will find diamonds. I tried one or two . If anybody try this one

<BR>

  This one will work and i'm sure others.

http://www.met.tamu.edu/cgi-bin/phf?QAlias=x%0als 

  </FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">6.- Make a

search 

  in the domain edu and search only the links that reffered to cgi-bin/phf!!! 

  <BR>

  Is this kool or what!!! Again i'll use digital

http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&what=web&kl=XX&q=domain%

3Aedu+link%3Acgi-bin%2Fphf&search.x=55&search.y=5<BR>

  </FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">7.- make a

search 

  without the domain to see what you can find. Still the most are <BR>

  univercities..(Probably the guy was right)

http://www.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&what=web&kl=XX&q=l<BR>

  ink%3A cgi-bin%2Fphf&next.x=43&next.y=9<BR>

  Allright for those who don't know about domain:, host: link: etc press

the next 

  link<BR>

  , or read. <BR>

  What? Offcourse HCU pages. you can find a lot about searching the net. An

other 

  good tactic is to <BR>

  read the help files of search engines. There are all in there. in front

of our 

  eyes. All we have to do is <BR>

  just press the little button named Help.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">SEARCH. Search 

  for Simple Nomad's WEB hack FAQ. Many interesting things in

there.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">SEARCH. Find

GTMHH. 

  Very educational, All about email headers, etc.</FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Hey ! I

don't give 

  you these links, because +Orc's tactic is to leave <BR>

  something for the &quot;student&quot; . Anyway they are the easiest think

to 

  find. </FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">I want to send 

  my greetings to Aesculapius (where are you lost?). I love this

great +Teacher!</FONT></FONT></P>

<P align="CENTER"><FONT size="2"><FONT face="Comic Sans MS">Of Course
