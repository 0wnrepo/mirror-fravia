<BR><I>Well, here we go with another nice essay by LordCaligo. I hope 

that this will represent only the FIRST of a series of essays on this 

subject (by LordCaligo and others) since there are MANY other tricks 

that can be applied to this field. LordCaligo speaks here about the 'fake' account 

techniques... yet this technique, very useful for powerusers, may be superfluous for small user. For little quiet anonymity lovers I would just like to remember a 'legal' 

simple technique that I have used (and I still use) a lot: "handkerchief-providers" (or "throw away trials")<BR>The idea is NEVER to pay for your access to the net. You get a 'one month trial free' 

account from AOL, nice, use it: do everything you want, download heavily, play on line, whatever, 

for a whole month... and then... bye bye AOL. For the 'second' month you'll get -perfectly legally- a one month trial account from, say,  

MSN. Nice! Do everything you want, download heavily, play on line, whatever... when even the second month ends, you'll get a one month free trial account from Compuserve, or whatever, do everything you want, download heavily, play on line, and so on... you dig it? There are many 'minor' providers too, and the concurrence is fierce! Some of them offer now (in Europe) THREE months free trials. Wow!<BR>And then, after, say, one year, YOU begin everything anew, legally, with your own name! If you read the instructions you'll see that you are not supposed to ask for a new trial offer for the next 10 months. Therefore you may perfectly legally ask for a new trial offer after 11 months! (And, of course, you could come to the idea of asking for another trial with your girlfriend's name, your baker's name, your oncle's, whatever... well, the point is... every time you enjoy for free such a trial provider, just use the many free pages and free intrnet addresses providers that exist on the deep deep Web!<BR>In a short time you'll have collected 20 or more 'sleeping' internet addresses and pages. After three or four months you'll be able to use the surviving ones without much worries!

<BR><BR>

A last consideration if you follow LordCaligo's techniques below... when you fake an address and that address (and the telephone number you have given) are going to be checked, use some name (and people) like 'Wong' or 'Kiczielsky', or 'M'bungo' and give address (and corresponding telephone) in a huge house full of people that barely speak English (or German, or Italian, or whatever you and your provider speak with each other). You'll find a lot of these 'anonymity baits' with a little social engineering. Such 'refugees' decoys are the best thing you can use when you are covering your tracks and/or faking addresses: confronted with a family of 25 immigrants that do not speak the country language nor understand what the cuckoo is going on, the providers' agents themselves won't be able to understand if there was -or not- any malicious intent :-) Enjoy!

I. INTRODUCTION



I'm writing this essay because fravia+ (<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.ht%20tppabs=  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.ht%20tppabs='" tppabs="http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.ht%20tppabs=" http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.ht"m">http://207.30.50.126/fravia/fravia.htm</A>)

asked for it. He saw my first one (HOWTO create secure webpages) and 

encouraged me to write a new tutorial - this time I'll try to show you 

how easy it is to get free access to the Net with all its advantages 

AND disadvantages. It's not the first and it won't be the last tutorial

about this topic, but that does not matter =;-]



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------



II. BASICS



Creating fake accounts is as easy as reading this text - after you

understood it for the first time, you'll never have problems any more.



The idea is very old, "hackers" used it as soon as the Internet got

popular and providers growed up all around the world. It's not my

private scheme, everybody with a BIT of knowledge "discovered" it

some time ago.



At first, what do we need to sign up for an legal account?

We need (of course) a name with address, telephone number (not always)

and ... how to pay normally?



The easiest way is to use one of the little fancy plastic cards every-

body has, we just need to use our personal, private number for it

(more in chapter III.) . Many providers give you the possibility to

sign up directly when online (Compuserve, AOL, UUNET). I don't know

how it works in your country, I can only speak for Germany.



A second way would be a signup with account- and bank code number.



 -------------------------------------------------------------------------



III. HOW TO FAKE A SIGNUP



Okay, just remember what we need:



1. A name, address & telephone number



 Easy to "fake", just imagine some. NEVER use names or telephone numbers

 of known people or friends, just really IMAGINE one.

 If you don't have any imagination, take a look to a local telephone

 book.



2. Credit Card- or account number



 There are many tools generating VISA- or Discovery-Numbers, see Chapter

 VI. Just go fetch some of them or make it on your own...

 

 Account numbers... erhm, I don't know any algorythm for it, just read

 some announces or similar. You'll find numbers of different persons soon.

 

3. Sign Up



 No go sign up ! You have all you need.



 Some providers like AOL (in Germany?) do not only check if the algorythm

 is VALID, they compare the Credit Card Number while you're online with

 a local VISA-computer. Just try out... if it does not work, try another

 provider or use account numbers (they DO exist, no comparison would

 be useful :-).



 ------------------------------------------------------------------------



VI. CREDIT CARD ALGORYTHM



The most popular card to fake is VISA, many many many generators are

out for all OS. 

If you want to create numbers on your own for some reason, here is the 

algorythm:



VISA numbers have six digits. You take all odd numbers (the 1., 3. ...15),

double them and divide by nine (9). Add the remainder up and now add all 

even numbers (the 2., 4... 16).

If you can divide the resulting sum by ten, it's a valid code. There is

no connection between the VISA number and its user.



I hope you could understand me. 

Here is a PASCAL-program for checking valid numbers (VISA, MasterCard, 

American Express & Discovery):

V. DISADVANTAGES



Hey, there's always the possibility that they go fetching your caller

ID or trace your line back ! Just FAKE ON YOUR OWN RISK! ;]



But there are more disadvantages:



 - you'll have to re-signup after a short period (depends on the provider)



 - you don't have a permanent email-address (!!): get one at an 

   independent free service provider like hotmail, rocketmail or 

   take a look at http://payfree.home.ml.org/freemail.htm



 - your provider cannot provide webspace because your name

   changes every new signup: get space somewhere else



 - and more ...



 ------------------------------------------------------------------------



VI. LAST WORDS



Okay, this is a short essay, it was written in about an hour. But I

don't think there is much to say about fake-accounts - everybody can

create and use them ...
