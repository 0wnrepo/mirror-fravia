Reinitializing Lotus 1-2-3 DOS versions 2.01, 2.3, and 3.1



by: Tomboy

date: 31 March 1998



Introduction



As much pleasure as one gets from completing a successful crack

(especially if it was difficult), I find it even more exciting to

"entice" a program into doing the hard work for me.  This paper

demonstrates how several programs can be reinitialized with new owner

information with a minimum of effort.  In each case, it was possible to

automate the process using a DOS batch file.



Situation



I like and use Lotus 1-2-3 for a number of reasons.  The reason most

relevant to this discussion is the presence of copy protection in early

versions (up to 2.01) which was followed in later versions (2.2 and up)

by having to initialize the original system disk with your name and

company information prior to using the program.  Over the years I have

obtained (primarily at local computer shows) every version of Lotus

1-2-3 from 1A through 2.3 as well as an odd copy of 3.1.  Regrettably,

some of these copies were used and had been previously initialized with

the old owner's personal information.  This was unsatisfactory to me and

I wanted to change the information to my own name.  Of course, the

manuals for these programs state that once initialized, the name and

company information cannot be changed.  Challenge accepted!



Discussion



Target 1: Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.01

Need: valuepk1.zip (or unused value pack diskette from original software

package, very rare!)

Available from: Lotus ftp site.



This version of 1-2-3 was shipped as a copy protected product.  With the

demise of disk based copy protection in the late 1980's, Lotus started

including a copy protection removal program in the package.  It was

placed on the value pack diskette along with some extra screen and

printer drivers.  Running this program would remove the copy protection

by creating a new loader program, 123.EXE, and deleting some of the

files associated with the Softguard protection scheme (the original

loader 123.COM, SGS0300.SUP, AND CML0300.FCL).  In the process of

removing the copy protection and creating the new loader, it was

necessary to provide a user name and optionally company information. 

This information was written inside the new loader in an encrypted

form.  Each time the loader is executed, the initialization information

is displayed for several seconds and then the spreadsheet finally comes

up.  Interestingly, the value pack diskette can only be initialized

once.  Several important files are erased (and thoroughly destroyed by

overwriting with garbage before deleting) during the creation of the new

loader.  While the value pack diskette and be used to remove the copy

protection from multiple copies of the Lotus 1-2-3 system diskette, the

initialized information remains the same.  The following value pack

files are associated with the initialization process:



File		Size		Fate after initialization

-------------------------------------------------

INIT.EXE	6994		Unchanged

INIT.RI		4022		Unchanged

INPUT.EXE	19376		Overwritten, then Deleted

NAME.EXE	21590		Overwritten, then Deleted

REMOVE.EXE	73408		Modified



I wasted a lot of time analyzing the 123.EXE loader and its encryption

scheme in the hope of understanding the algorithm and then changing the

information.  It was during an examination of the remaining files on an

initialized value pack diskette that I had a breakthrough.  One file,

REMOVE.EXE, was found to contain the image of the initialized 123.EXE

loader.  In fact, it contains two images, one for 1-2-3 version 2.0 and

the other for version 2.01.  It appears that the loader is initialized

inside REMOVE.EXE and is then extracted during the copy protection

removal process.  Based on this information, I obtained an unused value

pack diskette and as expected found that the original REMOVE.EXE

contained an UNINITIALIZED copy of the loader.



** Can't find an unused value pack diskette?  Fortunately, Lotus has an

archive, valuepk1.zip, on their ftp site containing the needed files. 

Just unzip it to a floppy and you are ready to go. **



OK, by now you are probably getting the same idea I had.  Lets

initialize an unused value pack disk (a copy! not the original) and then

manually extract the new 123.EXE loader.  The copy protection removal is

done in two distinct steps: 1) provide initialization information, and

2) update system diskette.  The first step initializes the 123.EXE

images in REMOVE.EXE.  The second step is optional and can be aborted;

just don't put your 1-2-3 system diskette in the drive when prompted. 

In any case, only the first step is needed for our purposes.  Using

debug, the 123.EXE image can be located in REMOVE.EXE and extracted

(version 2.0 loader starts at offset 5856h and is 29A8h bytes long,

version 2.01 loader starts at offset 820Eh and is 2C31h bytes long).  I

have created a batch file, 123v201.bat, to do the extraction

automatically.  The source is given below, ?BTW can DOS batch files

actually be considered source code? ;-).

echo     This program creates an initialized (personalized) copy of 123.EXE

echo     LOTUS issued to remove the disk based copy protection from this version

echo     of LOTUS 1-2-3.  LOTUS stores the initialization information inside

echo     123.EXE in an encrypted form.  While it would be possible to reverse

echo     engineer LOTUS's encryption alogorithm and create a program that would

echo     directly update the executable with new information, this is a lot of

echo     unnecessary work.  It turns out that an initialized copy of 123.EXE is

echo     created inside of REMOVE.EXE during the copy protection removal process.

echo     All that has to be done is run REMOVE.EXE, input the initialization

echo     data and using this program extract the initialized copy of 123.EXE.

echo     To prevent REMOVE.EXE from being reused, several helper files are

echo     intentional destroyed after the initialization procedure is completed.

echo     This program protects these files by keeping master copies of them

echo     in a ZIP archive and restores them at the end of the process.

Challenge met!, now I can reinitialize the 123.EXE loader any time I

want.





The intermediate years....



Lotus "almost" dropped disk based copy protection in version 2.2 of

Lotus 1-2-3.  The program required the user to initial the 123.EXE

loader with owner information before the program would run.  However,

this initialization could only be performed on the original system

disk.  It turns out that the system disk contains a specially formatted

track which must be present for the initialization process to proceed

(this track is completely trashed by the install program after the disk

is initialized making it impossible to reverse the process).  Of course,

you couldn't initialize a copy unless it were made with a really good

bit copier or a deluxe option board.  This version was simply cracked by

nop-ing the call that displays the initialization information.  Nothing

really interesting here so I will not discuss it any further.





Target 2: Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.3

Need: Lotus 1-2-3 version 2.3 system disk

Available from: ?



Again, Lotus required the user to initialize the 123.EXE loader before

it would run.  However, they did not put any special tracks on the

system disk this time so you could initialize a copy instead of using

the original (but Lotus sort of forgot to mention this in their

manual).  In this particular case, Lotus added some code to kill program

execution if the display initialization information routine was tampered

with.  Examining an initialized loader and using a little ZEN, I found

the data area that the install program uses to determine if the loader

has been initialized.  It is a six byte string that starts at offset

1A24h and contains the following information: " CONAN".  The

initialization information itself and the program serial number are

stored as encrypted strings at offsets 1A2Bh to 1A88h.  The bytes at

1A2Bh-1A2Ch and 1A87h-1A88h are a checksum for the name and serial

information.  Changing any bytes in the initialization or checksum

fields gives a program error and a quick return to DOS.



Just for grins the encryption scheme used for the initialization and

serial number strings was analyzed and found to be:



encrypted byte = FFh - starting byte



Unfortunately, the algorithm for calculating the checksum bytes was not

as straight forward and could not be determined.  Otherwise, we could

make a program to reinitialize the loader directly.



Changing any one of the six bytes in the " CONAN" string caused the

install program to prompt for new owner information and write it to the

loader.  This is GREAT!, but oh no!!! the %^&*$ install program wrote

the new information at offset 1B24h instead of 1A2Bh (overwriting some

program code in the process).  I do not know why the install program

does this, but it sure was aggravating.  Despite this minor setback, the

new encrypted initialization information was found to be correct.  It

can be easily moved from 1B24h to its proper location at 1A2Bh using

debug.  Fixing the overwritten code at 1B24h and saving the result gives

a new reinitialized loader that works perfectly.  The batch file below

does it all automatically for you.

echo     This program reinitializes the 123 release 2.3 INSTALL disk with new

echo     once the INSTALL disk is initialized during the first installation,

echo     this information cannot be changed.  In fact, the INSTALL.EXE program

echo     can be tricked into reinitializing the disk, but regretably it places

Challenge #2 completed.





Target 3: Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1

Need: Lotus 1-2-3 version 3.1 system disk

Available from: You will need to find your own copy of this one.



Lotus decided to change things a little and put the initialization

information in INSTEXT.RI instead of the 123.EXE loader.  Using some

more ZEN, the bytes that indicate whether or not the program has been

initialized were found at offsets 9952h-9955h.  Simply hex edit these

bytes to 00h and save.  The install program will now prompt you for new

user information and update INSTEXT.RI.  This time everything is put in

the right place.  Now that was easy!  This was trivial that a batch file

is unnecessary.



Challenge #3 completed.





Conclusions



Often the first impulse when tackling a new program is to jump into the

code and start tracing away.  As the above examples show, this may not

always be necessary.  Getting a program to do the hard work for you can

save a lot of time and brain power for those really difficult projects

on your "to do" list.  Think it through before you start wacking at the

code and you may find a more enlightened path.
