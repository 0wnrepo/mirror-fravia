                 Hi Fravia+!



                 You asked for our opinion about your plans on reshaping

                 your site, so here is mine.



                 1) I agree, that you have to stop adding simple (keygen,

                 patching etc.) essays and concentrate on papers. However,

                 there will always be newcomers (one day some of them

                 will be teachers) who need to learn the very first steps.

                 Therefore, <FONT color=red>keep even the simple essays up</FONT> or if you want to

                 purge the database (not enough space etc.) pass those

                 to +Greythorne or somebody else who willing to host them.

                 The knowledge already collected should be available to the

                 beginners.



                 2) What kind of essays to accept in the future. I think

                 <FONT color=red>you should not categorically reject assays dealing with

                 protections</FONT> if they have a teaching value. Look at the very

                 fine essay of bb's on simulating user input. It practically

                 deals with nag screen elimination (pure cracking task), yet

                 from a unique stand point teaching much more about how the

                 program works than just finding the nag jump. Besides, if

                 someone just want to have winzip surely will use oscar, so

                 this assay has little value for the greedy ones. Therefore,

                 I suggest to evaluate each essay by comparing the teaching

                 value to the damage it might cause to the programmer. On

                 this base <FONT color=red>I support the idea of accepting papers without

                 mentioning the specific target</FONT>. It is also obvious that

                 the more generally applicable the approach the more value

                 it has.



                 3) I think one good criterion might be that the new essays

                 should contain some serious coding (more than just a

                 a patch or a key generator) like rewriting some part of

                 the program or adding some new function to it.

                 This should help us to move on a new level where not just

                 a superficial understanding of the code required, but a

                 deeper understanding how the program, the compiler,

                 and the operation system works together.



                 Finally, I wish you good luck and keep up the nice work,

                 your site means a lot to me.

                  

                 Regards,

                 Zer0+</PRE>
