How to perform some magic reversing with good old BRW

You shrink your target a million bytes, you rip  all protections off... 

and it works!



by -= F**KingKrazy =-



31 March 1998

</CENTER><HR>

I intended to begin this text with its title but I did not found a

suitable one. I thought I could call it "When a Protection Scheme is

Good For Nothing" or "The Easiest Crack I Ever Did" or "The Most

Negligected Protected Program I Ever Saw". You choose.



In this text, I will show how to reverse the protection scheme of a 

very useful OCR program called Cuneiform 1.31 (Jan'98). 

You can find it at http://www.ocr.com/html/west.html, of course you 

should pay for it if you intend to use it in real life.



This kewl program uses a double protections scheme: use counter and

registration password. The scheme cripples some functions after 30 

days, that is: the target allows you to scan and save 30 pages as trial. 

After the trial is expired you may continue to scan and recognize documents 

but all the save, append and export functions will stay blocked until you 

enter the password for registration.



I am going to use only one tool for this crack: BRW 4.5 which you can find

everywhere on the web (for instance at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~bela/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~bela/'" tppabs="http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~bela/">http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~bela/</A>).



More about BRW? Read "<A HREF="ultrae2.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ultrae2.htm">An interesting tool: BRW</A> (32-bit reverse engineering)"

an essay by Fravia+.



Ok, now that you have got the victim... er... the target and the tool, let's

have fun.



Install the program. During the installation you will be asked to enter

names for user and company.



Before you continue to read, explore the target, learn how to, and mainly,

use it until the grace scanning counter expires.



So, you scan and save...scan and append...scan and export... suddenly a

"beg screen" shows up telling that your trial period expired and asking 

your datas for registration and password code to unlock the blocked

functions.



Ok, trial expired, cracking time, let's reverse the relevant code.



Now snoop a bit the .EXEs and .DLLs to obtain info on compiler used to produce

the proggie, export libraries, function names, etc. You can use quickview

or a similar utility.



This will help you to choose the easiest way to crack our little beast.



You could also explore the Windoze registry, but I forward you that only three

explicit reference to the program have been found there and are all worthless 

for the kind of crack we intend to do.



At this point you could opt to:



1. Use the "traditional" method to defeat the protection:

        - run the program

        - go to main menu help option

        - activate the register screen

        - enter a fake password code

        - fire S-Ice

        - bpx GetWindowText (in this case better than hmemcpy or

                             GetDialogItemText)

        - then click Ok, F11, severals F12, lots of F10 e somes F8

        - feel the code

        - ...and, if you are a newbie

        - be lost

        - get fingers cramps

        - or worst, get a tendinitis

	

2. Use W32Dasm to generate dead list of all suspects .EXE and .DLL:

        - analise every routine that's worth

        - drink a lot of coffee

        - trace a lot of jumps and calls

        - fell asleep in front your computer

        - ...and, once again, if you are a newbie

        - get mad and lose your hair



3. Use BRW to snoop all the suspects .EXE and .DLL:

        - "see" the program resources

        - discover where is the weak link dialog (i.e. the beg screen)

        - rip off the weakness

        - ...and, if the program work after the crack

        - experience a feeling of great satisfaction



Since the compiler of our target is Borland C++, I choose the last option due

statistics on my own cracks, about 25-30% of protections schemes applied

to programs that uses high level languages compilers with standard libraries

can be broken this way (stranger than a bit huh?!).



Ok, let's continue.



1. Run BRW

        - Load the first file to be snooped: CUNEI.EXE.



BRW show us:



BITMAP

  CUNEIFORM_LOGO        // the splash screen logo, rip it off

DIALOG

  ABOUT                 // if we rip this off, goodbye splash screen

  DIALOG_1           

STRINGTABLE

  22

ICON

  CUNEIICON    	

  

Save the file (project), minimize BRW and run Cuneiform.



Look! The splash screen is gone and the program still works.



Humm...the CUNEI.EXE did not CRC check, has few resources visible, and seems

to be a shuttle module only.

  

2. The next suspect CUNSDLL.EXE



Resources shown by BRW:

	  

BITMAP

   BRIGHT_MASK

   :

   :

   PORTRAIT3_PICT

MENU

   MAINMENU      // has, inside HELP menu, the options we will never use after

                 // the crack

DIALOG   

   32   DIALOG SHOWING LICENSING   // this will never appear after the crack,

                                   // so we can rip it off

   :

   Follows dialogs used by the program and should not be removed.





Our interest is in the MAINMENU. Let's change it.

 

POPUP "&Help"

       {

       MENUITEM "&Contents\tF1", 1794

       MENUITEM SEPARATOR                          // not necessary anymore

       MENUITEM "How to &Register...",1810         // forget it dude

       MENUITEM "Tech &Support", 1812              // ask support for this

                                                   // cracked version

                                                   // if you dare

       MENUITEM "&Password and Registration", 1808 // what you think we are

                                                   // trying to do

       MENUITEM "A&bout Cuneiform...", 1796        // we already know who

                                                   // you are

       }



So, we will stay with Contents F1 just to mantain the Windoze standard.



Again, save the project, run it and test.



If you did not messed up anything, the program is still running fine.



Of course, you still can't save a scanned doc and the "beg screen" also

shows up.



At this point we know that no effort was made to protect the .EXEs against

external modifications and it is clear that if we find the "weak link dialog"

the chances to defeat the protection by ripping it off are almost 100%.



3. Now the .DLLs



ACCUPAGE.DLL    // Accupage driver for HP scanners

APLIB1.DLL      // not interesting for our purpose

APLIB2.DLL      // same

BC30RTL.DLL     // same



BMP.DLL         // worthless resources, but the program may check

                // if file exist

For this .dll BRW shows:



BITMAP

   197          // publicity, rip it off

   198          // same, rip it off

   199          // same, rip it off

DIALOG

    93          // rip it off

    95          // rip it off

    98          // rip it off

    99          // rip it off

STRINGTABLE

    401         // rip it off

    416         // rip it off

    800         // rip it off

    820         // rip it off

    900         // rip it off



Save the project, run it and test.



The program runs fine.



CODCTC.DLL      // not interesting for our purpose

CUNCHECK.DLL    // same

CUNOLE.DLL      // same

CUNTWAIN.DLL    // same

C_COMMON.DLL    // same

C_PIXDF.DLL     // same

GROUP4.DLL      // same

HL.DLL          // same

OWLCTC31.DLL    // same

SCANHP.DLL      // same

SCANMK.DLL      // same

SCANPIX.DLL     // same

SG5W30.DLL      // same

TCLASS31.DLL    // same

TGCALL.DLL      // bridge routines, but no resource in this file

TIFF4.DLL       // not interesting for our purpose

TIFFDLL.DLL     // same



TIGER.DLL       // humm...dangerous at first sight

For this .dll BRW shows:



CTC 

  COPYRIGHT  	// Cognitive Technologies product number



My intuition tells me not to remove this resource, but you can do a little

experience yourself:



        - minimize BRW

        - backup this .DLL

        - maximize BRW

        - rip off the COPYRIGHT resource

        - save the project

        - run Cuneiform and...



Huah hah hah hah!...You screwd up the program!



Ok. Calm down, restore the .DLL using the backup you have done (didn't you?).



The program is running fine again.



Let's continue our scouting and snooping.



TRESRC.DLL      // yesss, finaly the resourse we are wanting

For this .dll BRW shows:



DIALOG

  99            // rip off this damm thing

STRINGTABLE

  22

  32

  100

  :

  :



Save the project, run, test, test, test.



Yesss, Yesss, Yesss! Unbelievable easy! And works!



A program as good as Cuneiform deserves a better protection!



Enough of ripping off. Let's compare the file size of the original files and

changed ones.



                Before   After

CUNEI.EXE       109584   27648

CUNSDLL.EXE     531968   536080 

BMP.DLL		316928   5632

TRESRC.DLL	12800    5632



Quite reasonable amount of disk space saving, so if you BOUGHT this program 

and are really and totally legally using it, as you should, you better 

CRACK IT NEVERTHELESS in order to spare all this wasted space on your own 

harddisk.



This proves that no routine protected the critical files from being altered,

no tricks, no traps, and despite of the supposed double protection scheme

the program was easily cracked in a few minutes.



I will not explain why the protection was broken so easily using BRW.

Almost all good developers programming under Windoze API know very well why 

this happens.



If you are newbie on Windoze API you may learn something about, using the

tutorials you can find somewhere in the net.



Final notes:

        - sometimes only one tool, well known and well used, can offer

          a miriad of possibilities to reverse engineering

        - you must "feel" the code, but must "see" the resources too

        - Windowze is lame, and IBM is one to blame because throwed

          the towel too early

        - Windowze is lame, and Apple is another to blame because was too

          ambitious and too pretentious, a deserved death.
