<FONT size=+3>A word to the confused ones<BR>by Fravia</FONT><BR>~<BR>(July 1998)

<BR>~<BR><TABLE border=1><TR><TD>

While attending the Olympic games, Leon, prince of Phlius, asked Pythagoras how he would 

describe himself. Pythagoras replied, 'I am a philosopher', but Leon had never heard that 

word before and asked him to explain.</CENTER>

<PRE>"Life, prince Leon, may well be compared with these public games for in the vast 

crowd assembled here  some are attracted by the acquisition of gain,  others are 

led on by the hopes and ambitions of fame and glory.  But among them there are a 

few who have come to observe and to understand all that passes here."</TD></TR></TABLE>

Welcome, dear readers and visitors of this site, I'm sure that some of you will be a 

little amazed, and confused, for the quantity (and if I dare say it, the quality and 

peculiarity) of the information you'll find on my "pages of reverse engineering".<BR><BR>

The structure  of this site recalls the "climbing-descending" picture of Escher 

you'll be able to see

here</A> -->

 you should wander inside my site and peruse my pages 

at a leisurely pace, you'll eventually understand its Moebius-like topology.<BR><BR>

This site is mainly dedicated to a very noble (and fairly difficult) art: <FONT color=blue>reverse engineering</FONT>, 

i.e. individuating and gathering "hidden" or 

"lost" data in a "backwards" approach: from finished phenomena back to its hidden 

"code".<BR><BR>

There are many forms of reverse engineering the world around you: semanthic studies, 

for instance can be very useful (like rethoric) in 

order to "reverse engineer" a speech or a message from somebody.<BR>Although may be 

not as important as "industrial" 

reverse engineering, <FONT color=blue> 

software reverse engineering</FONT> is a science in its own rights and my 

extraprofessional activity has 

always been centered on the understanding of the "inner working" of the application 

I have 

used, in order to modify and ameliorate them if necessary (sadly, it is indeed necessary 

most of the time)<BR>

One of the main "sections" of my site is consecrated to this endeavour.<BR>

Most people are interested in the specific reverse engineering of 

<FONT color=blue>protection schemes</FONT>, 

i.e. the part of the software code that "protects" an application from being used 

fully, or for ever. 

Indipendently from its "gray" legal meaning, this is a good choice indeed (even if my own 

contributions are more oriented towards "general" 

software reverse engineering: my recent essays about "<FONT color=blue>filemon.exe</FONT>" 

should allow you to 

reverse engineer almost every windows95 application) because it gives us the opportunity 

to take 

many talented people on 

the bandwagon. Studying a subject in continue and relentless evolution (like protection schemes are, 

for obvious 

commercial reasons) implies moreover a continued evolution of our own 

techniques. You'll notice that we are already developing our own tools. The numerous 

contributions  you'll find in the "Academy" section 

have already improved our techniques and approaches (I myself gathered an incredible 

amount of knowledge). Such activities, as curious as it may seem, 

are more useful than harmful for the <FONT color=blue>shareware programmers</FONT>, 

who have - until now - 

protected their software in a miserable manner.<BR>You may also notice, perusing  

the Academy, that we do 

not care much for the "kind" of software used as target, which most 

of the time we don't need and don't use anyway, yet we care very much for the 

"weirdness" and "subtilety" of the 

protection 

scheme itself.<BR>There are some exceptions, though: the <FONT color=blue>TOOLS</FONT> 

we must use. The 

principal ones are Winice (a powerful debugger), IDA 37 and Wdasm (two powerful 

disassemblers) and BRW (Borland resources workshop, a collection of 

windows decompiling tools so powerful that its development has been purposely 

"discontinued" a couple of 

years ago... and that's quite interesting <I>per se</I>... speaking about our society "progress" 

and "development" :-(<BR><BR>

Protection schemes reverse engineering was moreover a field dominated 

by <FONT color=blue>+ORC</FONT>, 

an half - mythical being (there are on the Web sites that deal 

exclusively with the 

mystery that this person represented). +ORC ("the old red cracker") was a Master Cracker 

and great Philosoph, whose eclectic and now a little obsolete 

Tutorial you should by all means read (and head). 

+ORC is a "general" reverse engineer, not only a cracker, and his "social" reverse 

engineering studies are particularly beautiful. His reverse engineering of the barcodes 

(those little "stripes" codes you can see on any object around you) is by many 

considered one of the masterpieces in the whole history of "applied" reverse 

engineering.<BR>

+ORC was a mentor for many of us.<BR><BR>

<FONT color=blue>Anonymity</FONT> on the web is another field where you can apply 

reverse engineering techniques 

of various type. In this section fall also "stalking" (i.e. finding real 

information on people that are on the web, behind all the "noise" they may have made); 

"luring" (i.e. trapping somebody on a page that will reveal you some information 

on your 

target); "counter intelligence" (i.e. intercepting messages on Usenet that are useful 

for you and that are being exchanged by people you don't even know the name of) and many 

other interesting and very recent techniques that you'll be able to learn on my site.<BR><BR>

The search for <FONT color=blue>information</FONT> on the net is a science in its own 

rights, and there are 

many sites on the web that deal with this subject. I try on my site to help you understand how 

to use effectively the main search engines, and especially which ones to use for 

different endeavours (there are interesting differences between them). You'll find 

also some elementary information about <FONT color=blue>"combing"</FONT>, i.e. gathering 

results that others 

have collected, via "top counter lists", vigilant filter and usenet depots like 

Dejanews and e-mail query. A new searching technique: <FONT color=blue>klebing</FONT>, i.e. 

'reversing' a search, using the locations where the information seekers themselves  

<U>come from</U> as possible source of valuable related information is also explained in 

deep. During 1998 I will begin a section on <FONT color=blue>bots building</FONT> since it is 

more and more evident that if you nead real information you cannot rely on the commercial 

oriented search engines alone.<BR><BR>

A section of my site has been consecrated to the struggle against 

<FONT color=blue>commercial "smut sites"</FONT>: those sites that are increasingly 

swamping the Web offering extremely low level pornography for money (I'm not a censor 

and I have nothing against nude pictures - if given away for free). Indipendently 

from this specific struggle against smut, you'll be able to learn there some rudiments 

of CGI-script reverse engineering, i.e. how to nuke a whole site on the web 

(given some conditions) against the will of its owner.<BR><BR>

On a similar "web-reversing" line you'll find on my site 

a section dedicated to <FONT color=blue>Steganography</FONT>, the art of 

hiding a message inside a picture or a sound file, and a section dedicated to 

<FONT color=blue>Javascript tricks</FONT>, i.e. tricks you can for instance 

use to block access 

to a part of your site. Both 

these sections have been divided in a public accessible "elementary part" and in an 

"advanced part" that will require a little work from your side, which is good, since 

my intent is to let you learn, not to let you leech.

<BR><BR>



<FONT color=blue>Microsoft</FONT> is bashed quite oft on this site  

because we believe it is imposing a 

very poor operating system to the whole world through money and bad concurrence 

practices, not through intrinsic, "real",  value. In fact all Microsoft programs are so bugged 

and unstable, as you'll learn here on my pages, that one wonders about the 

mental sanity of people still happily buying and using them.<BR>Regarding Internet 

browsing, you'll 

find on 

this site some "snippets" and tricks that will allow you to "shut out" from your 

pages (or completely nuke :-) anybody 

that uses Microsoft's Internet Explorer instead of Netscape Navigator... of course 

this does not mean that we believe Netscape to be a "good" society, not indeed...

as soon as a "less  

commercial oriented" alternative in the browser scene arised (Opera, a beautiful configurable, 

fast and relatively small browser), we all jumped 

on it, forgetting  Netscape and his awful bugs.<BR><BR> 

A small section of this site deals with an interesting problem: 

is software reverse engineering actually <FONT color=blue>legal</FONT>? I had so many 

problems (on the net, at work, everywhere) that I wanted to clarify this. The law differs 

between the USA, the European Union and Japan (obviously, since the three have 

different economic interests in this field), and there are quite a lot of obscure 

and pretty vague law formulations which need and deserve to be studied and 

translated into normal language. Anyway -despite all crimoinalisation attempts, 

the days of the 'commercial' copyright 

are already 

numbered.<BR> 

See: reverse engineering (and mass team work for free) has ALREADY taken an enormous importance for the 

developing of new products. No I'm not speaking only of the (very important if slow) triumphing  

of free mighty Linux versus stupid buggy Windows. If you watch the landscape now (Mid-1998), with 

<FONT color=blue>Netscape decision</FONT> to give the source code of its <U>main product</U> Navigator, for free, to 

anybody who cares (<FONT color=red>copyleft</FONT> instead of copyright), hoping to push a 'mass team work' on the 

web to sink Micro$oft, it is absolutely obvious that copyrights are nowadays 

HINDERING development 

instead of protecting it... laws and policy makers have of course not noticed it yet... 

quite the contrary:<BR> 

The last concerted moves all over the world towards an <I>a priori</I> 

criminalisation of any sort of reverse 

engineering studies confirm also the <FONT color=blue>danger</FONT> that such knowledge represents for the political corrupt 

'establishment'. Governments are among the most obvious puppets of the huge corporations that now rule, 

and as an elementary  

exercise in 'reversing reality' you may also easily note a not so curious corresponding development: 

while reverse engineering studies are being criminalized, all forms of 

human exploitation (child labour, 

forced labour, even buying and selling human beings) are being de-penalised 

and more and more allowed (and media-hailed) in the name 

of the 'globalisation' of the 'free' markets... an hideous, commercial oriented 

development, which all 

over the world has brought more mass impoverishment than anything else before -bar wars- ever did.

<BR><BR>Yes, understanding the world is far from easy... and the web does not help much: an 

ocean of knowledge... about two centimeters deep! You'll find tons of useless information and frills 

everywhere, but this will not help you to understand what is really happening. For that 

you will have to 

learn how to "reverse" the messages you get... and I believe that the approach we are using here 

(taking concrete small examples and applying 'scientific reversing' to them) 

may deliver a very effective form of teaching for these purposes: you'll find it in 

the section that is slowly "taking off", and that I personally love: the

<A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">Reality cracking</A> 

section of my site.<BR>Ultimately I intend to leave the field of software reversing (busting 

protection schemes  

is IMHO far 

too easy to represent a real challenge for advanced reversers, I personally will not  

crack protection schemes 

any more) and concentrate on the three (related) fields of internet searching, 

anonymity concerns and reality cracking. As far as I have any 'plans' for this endeavour of mine, 

I intend to transform my site during 

1998 more and more into an 'anti-advertisement' fortress: studying, understanding, reversing and 

ultimately countering all the pavlovian tricks that advertisers are using all over the world to lobotomize 

<FONT color=blue>human beings</FONT> into 'consumers'.<BR>I will not be able to do all this without the help 

of the crackers, of the seekers and of all other friends out there whose brain has not yet being 

reduced to mud by tv-commercials.

<BR><BR>

There are many pages on my site... 

you may peruse everything at will, you are welcome. 

You'll also notice that my pages (with some exceptions) load very quickly 

because there are almost NO pictures on them (nor frames of course): the contents, not the frills, make 

this site the knowledge treasure it is intended to be.<BR><BR>

Do not be scared, nor paralysed if you don't understand everything immediately, 

knowledge is like one of the chill white wines bottled in the old lagoons I come from: 

you should 

sip it slowly and knowingly, else it won't do you no good.</FONT>
