<HR> <I>Well, this essay is a little on the easy side, yet I stick to our aim: we 

publish essays regarding useful tools for our trade... and  even if I 

personally  still prefer good old (DOS) psedit, it's always useful to 

have other nice Windows Hexeditors at hand :-)</I></CENTER><HR>

Comments:      I would like to apologize that this essay is out of

               sequence with what I had previously said; This is one

               that has been bugging me for a bit, and I figured an

               easy crack/patch would be fun for everyone.

 

 

Preamble:

 

   Hexpert is a great program for modifying exe's, dll's, anything that

needs to be edited, I would be tempted to use this one program over any

other.  It's stability is great, and it has 2 very simple protections, one

which I cracked in 5 minutes, the other I toyed with for 25 minutes.

I know of several other programs that operate on this procedure for the

first crack (winweather, for example.)

 

<HR>

 

Crack part 1:

 

   When you first run Hxpert32 (I will refer to it as hexpert), you get a 

load file screen....this is a great program to stick in your 'sendto' 

section of the windows dir.  You can fire any file off to it, to peruse

at your leisure.

 

   After loading the file, a very ugly screen pops up, proclaiming the

shareware status.  You can't even hit the space bar to close it down,

it's so annoying.  So instead of viewing any other file, let's view

hexpert instead.

 

   Make a copy (hxpert.ded), and we shall edit this first.  Sendto the

file, and begin to peruse it's contents.  Most shareware authors think

alike in one regard.  If they prepare to different programs (reg'd and

share) with conditional compilation, then they are very good about labeling

routines.  This is good for our case, because a search for the phrase/words 

of nag, share, free, regis, register, registration, etc usually will turn 

up several instances of their locations.  When we search for share, we 

get an occurence of it, with some other text in the file itself.  A little

further on there is are the words: &quot;Registered to:________&quot;.  If anyone 

can figure out how to add this to the 'about' screen, please post it.... 

I have no BRW to work with yet, so am not able to recompile on the fly

as +Fravia says. 

 

   Proceed to replace the words SHAREWARE with 00's.  Now, when you execute

the app, there is no begining screen, and no ending screen to contend with.

We are now 1/2 of the way finished with our crack.

 

 

Crack Part 2:

 

As you may have noticed while running this application, another annoying

nag screen pops up.  It tells us to 'register' if we find this program 

useful.  There are 2 ways the program can do this:

1) Count the number of operations we do (key strokes), and randomly send this

   when we reach a previously set number.

2) Use a timer, or a random timer.

 

Let's investigate the latter first.  I believe there has already been an

essay involving settimer, and killtimer.  These require 'push's for the

duration of the count.  If we let the app run with no other input, our

former guess should show no window (which it does not do), so we know for

a fact the 2nd choice is correct.

 

cntrl-d into softice.

 

:bpx settimer

:bpx killtimer

 

cntrl-d back out.

 

Let the program run, do nothing while it does.  Eventually, you will

break in on the killtimer because the set timer had been previously 

called. If you scan upwards in the code, you will see where the call 

came from.  This is the entire second protection scheme.

|:0040A173(C)

|

:0040A1C0 33C0                    xor eax, eax

 

As you should be able to see, there is a total of 5 calls made to this 

function;  after the fifth call, the annoying 'buy me' message is 

popped up.  Since each call is a one minute delay, we are given 5 minutes

before we are again annoyed by this bad protection.

 

Lets bpx on the flag location, to see if it's operated anywhere else in

the entire program...

 

:bpm 004168B8  ;it's not, trust me....

 

ok.  So how can we disable this protection?  The first and most obvious would

be to patch the jump, so that no matter how many times it's called, it will

go right past it.  But, after 0xFF times, what will happen? I dont know, and

do not intend to find out.  So instead, let's play with the code.

 

here is the relevant code again:

 

* Reference To: USER32.DialogBoxParamA, Ord:008Eh

                                  |

:0040A159 FF1568C44100            Call dword ptr [0041C468]

:0040A15F 33C0                    xor eax, eax

:0040A161 E982D1FFFF              jmp 004072E8

:0040A166 FF05B8684100            inc dword ptr [004168B8]

:0040A16C 833DB868410005          cmp dword ptr [004168B8], 00000005

:0040A173 7C4B                    jl 0040A1C0

:0040A175 8B8424AC060000          mov eax, dword ptr [esp + 000006AC]

 

after the inc dword ptr, we don't want it to compare.  So, using +ORC's

teachings, let's change it to

 

* Reference To: USER32.DialogBoxParamA, Ord:008Eh

                                  |

:0040A159 FF1568C44100            Call dword ptr [0041C468]

:0040A15F 33C0                    xor eax, eax

:0040A161 E982D1FFFF              jmp 004072E8

:0040A166 FF05B8684100            inc dword ptr [004168B8]

:0040A16C FF0DB8684100            dec dword ptr [004168B8]     ;decrease the increase.

:0040a172 90                      nop                          ;pad one byte

:0040A173 EB4B                    jmp 0040A1C0                 ;who cares, jump past

                                                               ;annoying nag screen.

:0040A175 8B8424AC060000          mov eax, dword ptr [esp + 000006AC] ;nag screen stuff

 

 

All wrapped up in one neat package now!

 

search for 'shareware' using hexpert itself, change it to 00's.

 

search for:

 

FF05B8684100833DB8684100057C4B

 

change to:

 

FF05B8684100FF0DB868410090EB4B

 

Thats it!

<HR><I>An addition frop Epic Lord</I><BR><BR><PRE>

Here is a small addition for daQ+'s essay about Hexpert32, Version 3.0.05. 

BRW works well for this simple crack. Just load HxPert32.exe in the toolkit 

and delete the shareware references. There are two of them. That will be 

enough for the crack :=)



Best wishes, Epic Lord</PRE>
