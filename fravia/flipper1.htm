for a couple of reasons:<BR> 

- Flipper doesn't use neither winice nor wdasm, he 

cracks with HIEW (and take notice: it is always a good idea to learn how to reverse 

engineer our targets with a whole collection of tools... heavy paranoid 

protection schemes 

specifically targeted against our beloved winice and wdasm are 

nowadays proliferating like 

mushrooms... and yet they can be easily cracked with symdeb! :-)

<BR>

- Flipper is reversing a Pascal target and knows Pascal enough to give 

us all some very interesting &quot;insights&quot; about pascal compilation... hey 

Flipper, what about being among the first Authors in our new future +HCU's project: 

&quot;<FONT color="blue">Compiler peculiarities</FONT>&quot;? (Starting October 1997).<BR>

Well, read and enjoy.<BR><BR>

<B>A small notice about pascal</B></I><BR>

First developed by Niklaus Wirth in the early 1970s, Pascal was intended 

primarily as a tool for teaching students the fundamentals of good 

programming practice. However, the clarity and simplicity of the language 

rapidly attracted interest beyond the world of academia, and Pascal has become 

a major programming language... almost in spite of itself.<BR>As most of the recent compilers 

add a great many features to Wirth's original specification, modern Pascal compilers 

can be just as powerful as the C programming language. In actual fact, 

 programming in Pascal (yet not in Delphi) has some clear benefits 

over programming in C. For one thing, the syntax of Pascal is less cryptic than C, and, 

more importantly, Pascal also does a great deal of checking so that the 

programmer is alerted to errors which a C compiler would let slip through.

(Yet I only use C and never really used Pascal... go figure :-)<BR><BR>

You'll find easily on the web: 

- Turbo Pascal (Borland);

- QuickPascal (Microsoft); 

- Prospero Pascal; 

- Mystic Pascal; 

- Borland Delphy 1.0 (complete version on PC-Plus superCD 35b, 

May 1997, 4 UK pounds)<BR>

<PRE>-- iniquity's inequality protection scheme --

(and some tips about pascal reverse engineering)

by Flipper (upg), 31 Aug 1997</CENTER>



When someone approached me a few weeks ago with the news that a new version

of Iniquity BBS had been released, I didn't think much of it. However, in

this short text I'll describe how to simply reverse engineer this simple

protection scheme. The protection itself is so simple, anyone without any

knowledge of assembly could figure out how to bypass it; I hope that this

file can be of some use on Fravia's page of &quot;bad protections&quot;, so that more

so called shareware authors can actually write something worth cracking.



Here's a list of what you'll need:



1. a copy of Iniquity 1.01 for DOS <A href="tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#183" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tppmsgs/msgs1.htm#183">[http://www.mirage.org/iniquityhq/]</A>

2. hiew 5.65 (everywhere on the Web)



Let's get started.. allright, install Iniquity, and run it. Nothing new, just

a different look in the configuration screen. So, what's to crack here? When

I started Iniquity up, it has &quot;Registration Number: 0&quot; (or something close

to those words) printed inside the status window. I've looked all over, but

I can't see any option to enter a serial number. Okay, so let's read what

the README!.1ST has in it.



(scroll down a bit, and you'll come to this..)

  <FONT color="purple">

NOTE: Begining with this version of Iniquity, it is now &quot;freeware/shareware&quot;.

      Everyone gets a freeware two node license.  If you want to run more

      than two nodes - you must register.  The price structure is as follows:



                        4 nodes - $50

                       16 nodes - $100

                       48 nodes - $150

                      124 nodes - $200



I did this because it has costed me thousands of dollars in compilers to

write the telnet server stack - and it will cost more to implement the

web server.</FONT>



I just have to say one thing before we continue to reverse engineer this

program; Iniquity was written in Turbo Pascal 7.0. That means that it most

likely was compiled with Borland's standard issue compiler for pascal, which 

you can get for free everywhere and is anyway sold for less than 100 dollars.

A good TCP/IP library (TPU unit) can be found by browsing through the vast

SWAG archives, and wouldn't cost a cent.. however, this person thinks that

people will pay for a bbs which is a 'telnet server'. You be the judge :-)



So, that's the protection right there. If you try and run a bbs with more

than two nodes, it will simply not work. So, if you run Iniquity like so:



*NOTE*, make sure to have the multinode option set to 'yes' before you try

        run Iniquity multinode.



C:\BBS\iniquity node 3



Here's the message that comes up below.



--begin snippet



detecting computer hardware [node 3]

  <FONT color="purple">

Iniquity is only registered for 2 nodes, for more nodes

please write to support at iniquitybbs@hotmail.com

					 </FONT>

--end snippet



Here's the plan. Load up INIQUITY.EXE in hiew 5.65. Press F7, and type in the

search string &quot;<FONT color="purple">for more nodes</FONT>&quot;. You'll end up at $614C, and there's the text

string in plain sight. Scroll down a bit to $6362, and you'll see the bytes

'55 89', which in pascal's case, happens to the be the code for the beginning

of a procedure. Press F4, and then F3, and you'll be able to view the ASM

source of the procedure. Usually, with pascal in general you can find the

code which uses a string directly below it, starting with the characters 'U&#137;'

and ending with a RETF, or a LEAVE statement.



You'll see something like this..



00006362: 55                           push   bp

00006363: 89E5                         mov    bp,sp

00006365: B80002                       mov    ax,00200

00006368: 9A3005421E                   call   01E42:00530

0000636D: 81EC0002                     sub    sp,00200

00006371: 9A0303421E                   call   01E42:00303

00006376: A3B8C6                       mov    [0C6B8],ax



There's nothing interesting going on here, so we'll just browse through this

sort of 'dead listing' and see if we have any luck :&gt; Now, knowing that this

program was written in pascal, we can usually assume the programmer has done

one of two things.



(1) the worst way to check something... like this ;-)



NumberOfNodes := 2;



 if ParamStr(3) &lt;= NumberOfNodes then

  begin

   .. run the bbs ..

  end

 else

  begin

   writeln ('please buy more nodes!');

   halt(1);

  end;



(2) a nicer, much neater way..



NumberOfNodes := 2;



 if ParamStr(3) &gt; NumberOfNodes then

  begin

   writeln ('please buy more nodes!');

   halt(1);

  end;



So, keep this in mind while 'guessing and testing' through the code. Sooner

or later, you'll come across a row of instructions that looks like this:



000068DE: 9A1F05291C                   call   01C29:0051F -

000068E3: 9AB70F421E                   call   01E42:00FB7 -

000068EC: 57                           push   di

000068ED: 9AB70F421E                   call   01E42:00FB7 -

000068F2: 6A00                         push   000

000068FE: 9AF404421E                   call   01E42:004F4 -

<FONT color="red">**</FONT>00006903: 803E68BC02                 <FONT color="red">**</FONT>cmp    b,[0BC68],002

<FONT color="red">**</FONT>00006908: 7670                       <FONT color="red">**</FONT>jbe    00000697A   -

0000690D: 1E                           push   ds

0000690E: 57                           push   di

0000690F: 9A4008421E                   call   01E42:00840 -

00006914: 9AF404421E                   call   01E42:004F4 -

00006919: BF14DA                       mov    di,0DA14

0000691C: 1E                           push   ds

0000691D: 57                           push   di

0000691E: 9A4008421E                   call   01E42:00840 -

00006923: 9AF404421E                   call   01E42:004F4 -

00006928: BF14DA                       mov    di,0DA14



The code that we're concerned about is at offset $6903.



&gt;00006903: 803E68BC02                   cmp    b,[0BC68],002

&gt;00006908: 7670                         jbe    00000697A   -



First, compare the node number entered on the command line (the ParamStr

function was called before these instructions). (J)ump if it's (B)elow or

(E)qual to the maximum number of nodes.



So, you could simply modify the value on line $6903, but there's an easier

way to let yourself use as many as 255 nodes maximum.



Simply change this instruction



00006908: 7670                         jbe    00000697A



to



00006908: EB70                         jmps   00000697A



forcing the program to jump to the loading sequence unconditionally.



That's all there is to it. I read a usenet post that stated &quot;<FONT color="purple">I'd like 

to see anyone get past Iniquity's new 128-bit encryption! heh.</FONT>&quot;



I don't know about you, but I sure didn't see any encryption while I was

poking about the asm code ;) a small note to all shareware programmers,

stay away from protections like this one, it certainly won't make you much

money, that's for sure.
