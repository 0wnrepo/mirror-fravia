time to follow all 'my' leads (as I would like) and because -unfortunately- I must 

waste a great 

part of my life earning it.  This site and its mirrors average 

 now 40,000 ~ 60,000 hits per DAY and judging from <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13

<BR>

Some questions need to be cleared: what's the value of 

a statement (on a software package) like this one: "You may not reverse engineer this software"?<BR>

Is it a ridiculous wishful thinking (like if you would write 'You may not wear red pants 

using this software"), seen that there is no LAW that forbid reverse engineering (see <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 

BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0><A href="legal.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/legal.htm">legal.htm</A>), 

or does it really confer to that software some (feeble) rights?<BR>What if we write "<FONT color=blue>you 

may not use the save-as option</FONT>" LEAVING that option fully implemented? Would using the save-as 

option in such case represent an infragement as well? What's the difference, if so, between 

leaving the save-as option implemented or either protecting poorly (or not at all) its use?<BR>

As you can see, there are a lot of matters that need to be better cleared... 

the recent attempts to 

criminalize <I>a priori</I> any reverse engineering activity should also be analysed in 

all their orwellian meaning...<BR>

<HR width=33% align=left>

If you are <FONT color=red>an University teacher or director</FONT> and are able 

to influence and/or organize workshops and/or conferences in your university, 

consider the possibility of inviting me.<BR>

I can present, with passion and purpose, a <U>general introduction to global 

reverse engineering</U>, any sort of <U>how to search the web</U> 

workshop or I can conduct 

more specifically oriented <U>illustrated lectures</U>,  

<U>practical exercises</U>,

 <U>field cracking seminars</U> and <U>technical workshops</U>.<BR>

I can teach my own new, 

innovative techniques or 

I can reinforce well-established methodologies through my 

reversing approach.<BR>

<BR>My lessons and seminars (up to 30 persons) are free (for universities and public 

educational institutes), yet 

I do request reimbursement for my travel and accomodation costs.<BR>

European Union Universities will always have scheduling priority.<BR>

For additional information concerning the content and level 

of the short courses and seminars, just <A href="info.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/info.htm" >contact me</A>. I can conduct 

workshops in English, German, French or Finnish, but I would suggest English, for obvious 

reasons... <BR><BR>

As an example here is the

last workshop I held: A simple semanthical/reality cracking 

seminar (this was held in Germany): we took the main Euroamerican newspaper (and CNN) covering of the US-leaded 

Multi-forces Landing in Somalia, plus the covering of their departure and we added 

some facts that emerged afterwards about the bad 

conduct of these same troops in Somalia. (Of course in order to gather all the 

relevant info and images from various net archives we 

proceeded also to reverse or bust some simple site-access protection schemes made in perl 

or javascript :-)<BR>At the end of the workshop, the 

existence of pre-prepared <FONT color=blue>patterns of disinformation</FONT> in the news

was quite obvious and I 

demonstrated (at least I hope I did :-) how 

such older 'disinformation modules' -once studied and reversed- can 

easily be <U>reused by the readers</U> 

in order to reverse <U>less obvious cases</U> of organised disinformation 

(like the actual "Kossovo" affair, which follows analoguous patterns).<BR>And yes, before you ask, these disinformation modules 

"develop" too, exactly 

like software protection schemes do :-)

<HR width=33% align=left>

Actually I don't need any more mirrors, thanks anyway.

<BR><BR><B>Some explanation</B><BR>

My old fortress was heavily syn-attacked in January 1999 and forced to close (the router frigged). I took 

the opportunity to held a short 'vacation' from the web and went back end-April with a new fortress that 

is now being heavily guarded and defended by wizard Kevin (nonetheless :-)<BR>Since the attackers 

are from the West coast of the States (and have been documented using 8 machines from a M$-stream 

at one given time :-) some visitors from that area may experience some problems (basically heavy automated 

trackwork :-) when accessing from West coast USA backbones (a backbone is the high-traffic-density connectivity portion of 

any communications network)<BR><BR>

Since the syn-attackers were beginning to bust my mirrors as well, some friends decided to 

set up a "mirror jungle". You'll be able to find lists of my many mirrors (not all of them working)
