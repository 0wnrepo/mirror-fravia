The web is text. All images and sounds notwithstanding, the web is text. It was 

created in order to exchange and store texts. Email are texts, and the whole 

Usenet is almost exclusively text... even  

Perl, the web-programming language that's now all the rage, is an acronym of "Practical Extraction Report Language" and was created to extract information from text files and prepare 

reports. 

It is evident: <FONT color=blue>because of the web</FONT> the 'written expression' 

has re-acquired an importance it did seem to have in part lost during the now obsolete radio, telephone and 

television aera (also known as "age of the frill-morons" :-)<BR>Yes: the web 

is text, an ocean of text, of messages and information 

that we must reverse. 

So we need means and tools to crack all this text. But we don't have them any 

more. So we go back to the text-crackers, the great rethorical 

wizards of ancient Greece, 

the masters of the evangelische text-exegesis, the incredible German crackers 

of the 'Quellenkunde' of the beginning of this 

now closing century.<BR>Since we can search, 

we find. The old lore. Since we can reverse we will learn how to crack - in spades -  

the pathetical 'protection schemes' 

used by magazines, newspapers, politicians, any deceiving writer 

email spammer, advertiser enemy.<BR>We are reversers, a new race... and 

a very old one. Beware.</B>

history of an almost forgotten lore</H2></FONT></CENTER>

<BR>

An 'exegesis' is applied 'reverse engineering' work on any written text. An almost 

forgotten Art as I said. The best reversers of this kind where a bunch of German history 

professors of the late XIX and of the beginning of this century, like Georg Waitz, 

Harry Bresslau, Ernst D¸mmler,

Oswald Holder-Egger and many more... These professors had not only exceptional brains and 

capacities but also, for a lucky historical coincidence, almost unlimited resources at 

their disposal. Since Germany was young and wanted to 'prove' its historical 'right' 

to be one of the great european nations, 

the exegesis of medieval text-sources "Quellenforschung", reached 

 highs that afterwards noone never obtained again. That's the reason most 

sources originally published (and 'cracked') between 1820 and 1915 are 

still being re-published and used nowadays (by the degenerated historians of 

to-day, who -mostly- don't know neither greek nor latin and tend to read 

(and publish) sources in their 

translated and non-collated versions... a truly barbarical degeneration when 

you think that most HIGH SCHOOL professors -not to mention the university teachers- 

could around 1900 read latin, greek... and often enough Sanskrit as well!) in fact,  

text-cracking and text-exegesis, and all rethorical lores, are sciences 

in DECADENCE! Yet maybe the web effect will now change this.

<BR>Alas! 

Stupid Germans went militarist twice and all their reversing cleverness 

notwithstanding all the German reversers went conquering their neighbours! 

The greatest text-crackers scene of this planet was almost completely destroyed! 

In fact all the students of the 

great exegesis wizards 

that 

were not killed during the first World War did die during the Second World War, and the whole 

'text-crackers' scene went down with them (hence the appearence and predominance of the completely 

useless and 'frill oriented' french school of the "Bloch and Duby sort" in the fifties and sixties :-)<BR>Yet not 

all great text-crackers disappeared... there have been some rare exceptions, the most 

significant of them 

being represented by Adolf Hofmeister, a student of the great Alexander Cartellieri, 

and himself last great wizard in text-cracking. Hofmeister survived in 

the small German university of Greifswald, and did even impart his teachings to 

a couple of younger students, Frithjof Sielaff being the most able one... but that is another (very interesting) 

story... :-)<BR><BR>In the <A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">reality cracking</A> section of my site 

you'll already find some outstanding essays that cover, at least in part, this same argument 

(for instance 

Martine Joly's <A href="marlbo2.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/marlbo2.htm">Rhetoric of advertisement, a "Marlboro Classic" Advertisement analyzed</A>, yet 

they are, like most anti-advertisement essays, mostly 'visual' oriented.<BR><BR>Nuff said, 

for now: Knwoledge of the lost exegesis techniques and of rhetoric will be enough (at least I hope) 

to reverse any text black and blue, at least compared with to-days almost absolute ignorance 

of these matters (and yet I believe that our reversing techniques are 

something that would be really worth teaching in the 

schools to-day).<BR>
