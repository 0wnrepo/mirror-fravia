<HR><PRE>

Hey man, I found your page really interesting.  I'm glad that there are

still some sites with REAL content out there. Ok, the reason I did

e-mail you though is because I don't know that you have really seen the

other side of an adult web-page.  Now, I agree with a lot of the stuff

that you said concerning smut pages, but not all of it.  For one, I have

NEVER spammed the news-groups or spammed with e-mail, and I don't

personally know any webmasters that do.  I'm not blind to the fact that

many of them DO participate in this kind of crap, but it is a gross

generalization to say that we ALL do it.  In my eyes, no self-respecting

web-master would spam, and I know that Many others share this opinion.

Ok, secondly, you make us sound .. well .. evil.  I got into it because

I needed some cash, and I know what I look for in an adult site, so I

figured I could try to give that to other people. Also,  I use an AVS

for two reasons:  First, to keep minors out (Isn't that a worthy thing?)

and secondly to make some cash.  Everyone needs to make a living

somehow, right?  Ok, another thing that I thought was kind of bogus

about what you said was:  "You steal a great number of bad scanned smut

images from the newsgroups (where

        anybody could get them for free, of course, but that's not the

point for you)."  Again, any self-respecting webmaster owns the

copyright to Any and ALL material he uses.  And, I know that I have

invested MUCH MUCH more than the $100 to Internic into my page.  Server

costs are high when you start getting 3000 plus hits/day.  And, when you

said that most users don't know that they could get the images for free;

well, although many don't know that .. some do, but even though you CAN

get it for free, it is so much easier and nicer to have it all layed out

there for you (thumbnailed and all).  So, the way I see it, some people

probably think:  "Hmm, do I want to waste my time searching for this

crap, or just Pay $16 per year and have it always at my fingertips??".

Which is due solely to the fact that Many Many people (especially us

Americans) are pretty damn lazy.

    So, in closing, I think that if someone wants to pay me some money

to view my collection, that is their decision, and it is not much

different than subscribing to an adult magazine.  Again, I am very

against spam, and I am very very against people who use false

advertisement to sell their product.  I believe that the internet is a

great great place to do business of all kinds, but many people do take

it way too far, and they are the ones who ruine it for us all.  Maybe,

instead of telling people to just target smut-sites at random (they're

All evil?!?!) .. you should have people do a little research on the

site.  Find out what kind of advertisement the site is using, and if it

is spam (evil) or whatever, or if they are charging people 20 bucks to

get into a site which is just pure crap, then more power to you.  Take

'em down! However, those of us who are honest web-masters , well, I

think that we should be able to do our business and not have to worry

about people fucking us over just because someone else gave us a bad

rep.  What do you think about all of this?  I look forward to hearing

from you :)



Sincerely,



Phil

Well, in a way you are correct, there is a lot of money to be made in banner

advertisement.  However, I have already gone down that road, and the work

required to get 3000+ people to come to my site each day was not worth it.

See, when I got 3000+ people a day coming to my FREE site, that would mean

about 25-40 dollars per day, which wasn't bad.  However, with an AVS I am

making between 60 and 90 dollars per day and getting LESS hits than before.

Plus, I am pretty sure that it will soon be against the law in the US to have

an adult site without SOME form of Adult Verification (Maybe it already is).

And, I'm not trying to sound paranoid, as I know that there is really nothing

the gov can do to patrol cyber-space, but that  is just another issue which I'd

rather not have to deal with.  Also, while I am makig OK money from my site

right now,  some of my fellow web-masters (some, ie not many at all .. but

there are some) Are making upwards of $100,000/year just off of an AVS.  Now,

if you ask me, that is really good money.

    I think that your friend with the 30's movie actress page is a

frickin'genius.  What a great idea.  If I could think of something, ANYTHING,

besides porn that I could sell legally on the internet (without putting a ton

of money into it, and still making at least as much as I am now, etc.) .. I

would jump at it.  I wonder where your friend came up with the idea for a page

like that?

    Ok, I have a couple questions for you.  Hope ya don't mind:



First, do you think that taking down pay-sites is really the BEST thing you

could do for the internet?  Wouldn't it be better to take out kiddy-porn

peddlers or something.  I mean, people who are REALLY hurting other people? (I

used to think that kiddie porn on the Internet was just a myth, until one of my

friends pointed out all of the chan's devoted to it on IRC .. it is disgusting

how many there are.  THOSE are the real bad guys).



2.  Have you ever been personally ripped off by a porn site, or do you know

someone who has?  (ie, paid to get in then found pure crap) Because, it's not

like anyone is saying to the person browsing the page:  "Hey, this material is

great!  If you don't sign up, we will kill you.  Death threat death threat!".

No one is forcing people to sign up for their site.  Yeah?



Ok, that is all I have for now.



Thanks for replying to the first message, and I hope you reply to this one too

:)

<CENTER><I>Well, I have decided to give a public answer, here it is:</I></CENTER>

<BR>

The problem with commercial smut-sites is that the very concurrence between 

them fires a spirale of harder and harder smut. In order to keep those 

90 dollars per day, in a sea of analoguous sites, you are compelled to 

go down a very steep smut road. Nice softerotik does not suffice to 

get people signing up: you'll go first to (realtively harmless) 

bondage, big tits and similia, then to 'mature women', 'torture', 

mutilation and so on... have a look at the (millions) of sites concurring 

now (may 1998) on the web for the (big, but limited) amount of 

lusers that would pay for the access... they use all tricks of the 

trade to lure people inside. Just for fun I'll report here some 

'key-words', taken from 

an "average" commercial smut site (there are far worse around), these 

should apparently help to get some clients (in order to get the 90 

bucks above in the difficult world of hard commercial smut concurrence):<BR><BR><FONT color=purple>
