Reversing Shampoo

<P>

  I didn't actually crack the shampoo scam, all I did was write this. But as with 

  any other protected thing, at least somebody knows the truth all along. 

<P>

  The truth here is that shampoo's bad for your hair. It cleans out dirt, but 

  also the oil that makes your hair shiny and strong. However shampoo's sold as 

  something your hair really needs, and the truth is suppressed. 

<P>

  There are several common sorts of soapy things. They attract oils by electric 

  charge, allowing the oil to be emulsified with the water. For some reason, 

  these 

  cleaners are themselves made from fats. Soap is made from animal or vegetable 

  oil, 

  and detergent is made from mineral oil. Detergents can be made more powerful. 

  Shampoo is detergent, just like dishwashing detergent, bathroom cleaner, and 

  engine block cleaner. 

<P>

  People used to use soap to wash their hair, as well as their dishes, clothes and 

  bathrooms (and horses, before there were engines.) Soap was better suited to 

  washing hair, because it didn't remove so much of the oils that are naturally in 

  hair. <BR>

  But the water supply slowly changed. It's now generally more alkaline, which 

  people 

  call hard water. When this started happening, soap didn't work so well. The 

  chemicals which make water alkaline make soap stop lathering well, and form 

  insoluble scum (eg. the ring in the bath.) So soap got less and less effective 

  for all 

  its cleaning uses. I guess the water was always pretty alkaline in some places, 

  so 

  soap was never an ideal cleaner. Around the beginning of the twentieth century, 

  household detergents became available. Detergents have no problem with alkaline 

  water, so they were really popular. They soon became cheaper than soap, too.<BR> 

  So 

  that's why people stopped using soap for almost everything, and started using 

  detergents. Detergents are excellent cleaners for most uses. 

<P>

  If you've tried using soap to wash your hair, you probably know how your hair 

  goes 

  all rough and tangly. This is worse if your water's harder (more alkaline.) I 

  moved 

  recently, and suddenly started having problems using soap in my hair. The 

  problem 

  is that hair reacts to acids and alkalis. 

<P>

  Each hair has little scales, like scales on a snake or shingles on a roof. Acid 

  makes 

  the scales lie down flat, which makes your hair shiny and smooth. (Ever heard 

  that 

  lemon juice is good for your hair?) Alkali makes the scales stand up, which 

  makes 

  your hair look dull and feel rough and tangly. Therefore hard water, which is 

  common these days, makes it harder to wash your hair. If you use soap to wash 

  your hair in hard water, then the combination of your hair's scales standing up 

  and 

  the soap forming scum makes your hair into a terrible mess. Then, since your 

  hair's 

  all tangled and rough, it's impossible to rinse out all the soap, which makes it 

  look 

  terrible. 

<P>

  Shampoo, being detergent, can rinse out of your hair fine even in alkaline 

  water. 

  That's its only good point. Its fundamental, but covered up, bad point is that 

  it's very 

  harsh, and damages your hair permanently. Conditioner was soon introduced as 

  people noticed that shampoo sucked the oils out of their hair dry and left it 

  all dry and 

  brittle. Conditioner puts artificial oils in your hair, and they stay their 

  just long enough 

  so that you don't associate the damage to your hair with the shampoo that caused 

  it. <BR>

  You have to wash your hair every day, not because it always gets dirty so fast 

  but 

  because the oils from the conditioner don't last and have to be replenished. 

  Conditioner wasn't used until shampoo came about. 

<P>

  But the real cheat in shampoo is when it's sold as being especially good for 

  your 

  hair. Expensive shampoos are in a way better, but only because the conditioner 

  that 

  comes with them is better at covering up the damage done by the shampoo. The 

  actual shampoo itself is pretty much the same as any cheap shampoo. The 

  professional formula, which will nourish your hair and make it grow more 

  healthy, 

  with vitamins and natural nutrients, gentle seaweed extracts, jojoba oil. . . . 

<P>

  Remember that your hair's dead. That exposes half of shampoo advertising as 

  lies. 

  Remember that shampoo is just detergent. That shows that most of the remaining 

  half is lies too. Remember that the oils your hair needs come naturally out of 

  your 

  scalp, as they've been doing for thousands of years before conditioner was 

  invented. When you think about it, nothing that is claimed about shampoo and 

  conditioner is true. 

<P>

  In a way, we really do need conditioner, as advertising implies. But the real 

  reason 

  why we need it is because our hair gets damaged by shampoo. This is just 

  another 

  case of using lies to help a bad product (shampoo) gain dominance over a good 

  product (soap), then introducing another product (conditioner) to compensate for 

  the 

  bad product's faults, and then tricking people into accepting huge price 

  increases 

  once they forget the good product. 

<P>

  The only good thing about shampoo is that it doesn't work any worse in hard 

  water. <BR>

  Does that ever get mentioned in advertising? The rest is lies, to fool you into 

  paying 

  $10 for a $1 bottle of perfumed detergent. 

<P>

  What to do 

<P>

  Soap is good to wash your hair with. Forget all the dregs of misinformation 

  spread 

  by shampoo manufacturers, and forget that soap is "harsh". Remember that the 

  problem with using soap is in the water, not the soap. You just need to solve 

  the 

  problem of the hard water, and soap is fine to use. I can recommend two ways. 

<P>

  If your water's not too hard, just substitute soap for shampoo, and use any old 

  cheapish conditioner. The conditioner will make the scales on your hair lie 

  down, 

  and let the last of the soap get rinsed out. You might have to experiment with 

  different 

  soaps and conditioners. Maybe some conditioner which is pH balanced is best. 

  Some "good ol" plain soap with no added water and perfume is probably best. 

<P>

  Otherwise, you can add some weak acid at some point in the washing process. 

  Since you need just a tiny amount, even cheap vinegar will do, without leaving a 



  smell. You could make a soap goo out of soap and water, and add a bit of lemon 

  juice. You could have a jug of water with a teaspoonful of vinegar in it, to 

  rinse your 

  hair with after soaping. Or how about pouring it into a plastic squirty bottle, 

  so you 

  don't spill it. 

<P>

  Another good thing is oil of rosemary. It stimulates your scalp, to encourage 

  the 

  natural oils to flow. Actually I haven't worked out how to get it onto my 

  scalp, since 

  there's all that hair in the way, but I've heard it's possible. 

<P>

  So in summary, shampoo had a legitimate claim as an alternative for soap. But 

  now 

  it's not sold by that claim, it's sold by lies. Soap's better for your hair, 

  and you can 

  still use it if you compensate for hard water.

<P>
