<!-- Fravia+ demonstrates some buggy javascript implementation by M$ :-)

     the document.lastModified (same as most date functions) return UTC

     times. Sort of GMT. The problem is with the date() function. Unfortunately,

     it just give the numbers without the UTC text. 

     Date() just interpret it incorrectly. 

     In fact IE (as usual) makes some 'assumptions' and 'corrects' the 

     document.lastModified time in accordance with your time zone, so it

     reads the document timestamp and, -say you are in CDT and that equals 

     -5:00, it adds 5:00 hours to the timestamp value. 

     The idea is that the document timestamp is always based on UTC, but 

     in Windoze this does not happen, even if you set the old DOS environment 

     flag ( SET TIMEZONE = yourTimeZone ) as I do.

     Netscape doesn't make this assumption. It reads the documents timestamp

     and assumes the clients timezone was used. Now, if you want to use software 

     that makes FALSE assumptions about your whereabouts, go on with M$, Windoze 

     and the whole bazaar... and be prepared for many more buggy inconvenients

<TD><H2>Gates, diediedie!</H2><HR><I>A very important project, since our main 

"holy" purpose is to eliminate this 

company and its servants (and lackeys) from our planet. The reasons should be 

obvious for anyone that 

can understand the difference between buggy and awful overbloated code and slick 

operating systems and applications, 

else try 

yourself to cut and paste two pages of text with Microsoft's pathetical 

Word for windows and you'll see what for crap many humans on this planet 

are being compelled to use :-) 

<BR><BR>Well, developments seem, for once, to run positively: 

when we started this section, more than a year ago, "Micro$oft bashing" 

was quite seldom encountered on the Web, now there are a plethora of sites 

that collect all possible anti-M$ information. A year ago M$ march towards 

world-domination did seem unstoppable: now they are in deep trouble: 

since windows comes now in more 

than three flawours: M$95, M$98 (a completely useless flop) and M$NT, even the most 

zombizied users are 

beginning to wonder if they shouldn't slowly look for alternatives and Linux is 

gaining momentum among 'lower' users and sweeping away NT among 'higher' users.<BR>

Moreover M$, even if it all but sunk Netscape through M$IE dumping and bundling, is 

now facing a much more terrible concurrence by Opera, a browser that, compared to

M$IE, remembers a good European car against one of those huge, slow, gas-wasteful 

and useless American cars.

<HR size=2>

A little bird told us that the fairly recent Micro$oft's 

flight simulator can be transposed and run from any hard disk 

without much problems.  

So if you happen to have a friend's friend's friend that has got 

from a public medialibrary a borrowed copy of a 'real' Micro$oft's 

flightsimulator 98 CD-ROM, don't ask him to copy it on your hard disk, 

since you could in that case run it without having paid a penny to 

Bill Gates's slaves, which in some countries and under some 

circumstances could be considered an unproper behaviour

<FONT size=+2>A legitimate question</FONT><BR><BR>

</CENTER>

As TWD asks in his Frontpage 

essay: <B>are our enemies at 

Micro$oft just faking "protections" while in the reality GIVING 

AWAY FOR FREE their allegedly "protected" software</B> in order 

to destroy any competition?<BR><BR>

There are indeed some evidences in this sense:</I></CENTER><PRE>

-    M$-protection schemes are not even stupid, they are distressed :-)

-    Many trial versions last 90 days (which is more than enough to

     keep any luser happy until the next "trial" release)

-    They give some programs away for free already, completely unprotected, 

     like for instance Iexplorer and FrontPage98 beta (Yes, FP98 has now 

     appeared *complete*, fully unrestricted, on many european magazine 

     CD-ROMS covers)</PRE><CENTER><I>

Yet I would like to observe a couple of things:<BR><BR></I><FONT color=blue>

THEY GIVE AWAY ONLY PROGRAMS THEY ARE "WAGING BATTLES" WITH<BR></FONT></I>

</CENTER>

You wont see any trial copy of "M$-Office" or "M$-Excel"... and I haven't seen 

any trial version of flight simulator 98 either... because Gates 

makes MONEY with that stuff (of course, as you'll have read above, it 

would be theoretically possible, if unpolite, to run a borrowed copy of 

Flight simulator from your own harddisk :-)<BR>

Anyway, if you will happen to see trial versions of these M$-product, that would 

be a pretty 

GOOD new: yessir, that 

would mean that they are <U>loosing ground</U> either in the office-suites or 

in the 'spreadsheet' 

corporate word, or in the flight simulator 

scene... that will mean that there appeared  

again some real "concurrence" (that they will have to ruin anew, that's the 

aeternal cycle of 'commercial' subhuman life, I suppose :-(<BR>

The whole strategy is as banal as it is easy: they have as much money as they want through 

the OS-monopoly, therefore they give away for free or "almost for free" or "bundled for free" a wordprocessor, say, until they 

bust Wordperfect, say, and then, as soon as the concurrence 

is dead, Micro$oft will never ever again ameliorate that crappie 

bugged software they pushed through and will leave the whole 

(incredibly stupid  and gullible) world with a tool (say "word", just to make an example :-) 

that everybody is de facto compelled to use and yet is so crappy that it 

does not even allow you to cut and paste properly without seeing your screen text 

flash away like a rocket! (just try 

to cut a longer text in Word and see if you are able to control 

your mouse! Those assholes did 

not ever bother to fix this <FONT color=red>shame</FONT> in their 

"new" pathetical Word98!).<BR>I hate them... as I already said. 

Once more: Micro$oft gives away for free only SOME programs... 

right now they are giving away for free (and <B>therefore</B> still improving) two main 

programs:<BR><FONT color=blue>Micro$oft explorer</FONT> to bust 

Netscape (this does not seem to work quickly enough for Gates, so they are 

already bundling their browser and will bundle it more and more <U>inside</U> the 

OS, hoping that people will HAVE TO USE explorer instead of Netscape as it 

will be a <U>PART</U> of the operating system itself, which leaves Netscape in 

the mud to use an almost tautological circumlocution... who cares? <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.operasoftware.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.operasoftware.com/'" tppabs="http://www.operasoftware.com/">Opera</A> 

is there! <BR>And they are giving 

away for free (1998) <FONT color=blue>FrontPage98</FONT> BECAUSE THEY 

ARE NOT YET ESTABLISHED ON THIS 

SOFTWARE SECTOR. Clearly Internet software hat now reached 

an importance that the smartest idiots at Micro$oft never 

thought possible, and all their software (and operating system) 

risks to sink like CP-M did as soon as we'll break free from 

the Microsoft-Intel devil alliance. Therefore they will do ANYTHING in order to 

get and develop a grasp on all Internet-related things, mainly in order to destroy 

the positive advantages of the web.

<BR><BR>

Yet cracking their applications may be useful nevertheless: I believe that +ORC's 

crack of Microsoft 

publisher (that you'll find inside his old <A href="howto42.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howto42.htm">lesson 4.2</A>) has 

indeed damaged them a little: MS-Publisher WAS proposed as a trial version 

and had a much bigger resell price at the beginning of 1997.<BR>You see the 

real battle, in that sector, is among Pagemaker, X-press and other giants, 

Microsoft aimed the "home newslettering" broad public 

with its Microsoft Publisher, a market where Microsoft has 

NO concurrence... I don't believe they will ever publish a trial 

version of their Encarta thing... should they do I'll not reverse anything 

else until I have cracked it!<BR><BR>And anyway...<BR></I><FONT color=blue>

WHO CARES WHAT THEIR 'clever' strategies and plans are<BR></FONT><I>

Remember +ORC's lesson 4.2: "the way they program they wont be able to dominate 

a portion of half-baked potatoes". So let's merrily keep our +cracker's  

promise:<BR></I><PRE><FONT color=green>We'll deprotect ALL Micro$oft programs, 

wherever they appear, 

whatever they use as a protection scheme</FONT></PRE><P><CENTER><H3>

Besides autumn 1998 carries very good news indeed for all M$-haters</H3></CENTER><BR>1) their windows98 

will enter software history as a huge flop... even zombie users, 

confused by all the windoze's variants, are fleeing in droves to Linux, and 

I have never heard of anyone that went back from Linux to Windoze without being 

pulled by his hairs :-)<BR> 

2) their so ruthless fight against Netscape 

(they were almost winning at the end) has been now 

thwarted and demonstrated useless and vain, by the incredible success 

of the (great) <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.operasoftware.com/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.operasoftware.com/'" tppabs="http://www.operasoftware.com/">Opera</A> browser... less than a million bytes and MORE functionality than 

both Netscape and Micro$oft browsersaurii together! No wonder that almost everyone is switching 

to Opera right now... among many other good reasons, I personally love 

the "do not load images" immediate switch on Opera's status line, most useful to avoid at 

a click all unwanted and delaying useless ads-banners when you sail the deep 

deep net and meet a 'commercialized' site.<BR><BR>Oh yes, yes, YES!... I wouldn't have dreamed 

this a year ago... but Micro$oft's 

grip is about to fade away... I feel it!

<B>DR2000's solution for changing search page url in 

Internet Explorer 4.0</B></CENTER><BR>

There is no built in future for changing search page url in 

Internet Explorer 4.0. But you can do it by changing one key in 

the windows registry. You can use regedit.exe program for that purpose. 

Run regedit.exe and find the following key:<BR> 

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\Search Bar.<BR>

Change it's value to the url of page you want (you can specify .html file on your 

hardisk). That's it! Now run Internet Explorer, open search bar, and there it is - 

the page URL of which you specified.

<B>DR2000's informations about Micro$oft's registration patterns</B></CENTER><BR>



Almost all of microsoft registration keys follow/will work with 

the following pattern 040-oem-7numbers that add up to 14, 

eg. 040-0121028 - 0+1+2+1+0+2+8 = 14. 

If the program needs an extra number just add 0 also a few 

programs will work with all 0 or all 9. (It is not widely know that 

windows will install if you use all 9's as the key, However this 

will not work if it is already installed and you are installing 

to the same directory).

I find out that the TRUE rule is: SUM of _7_ digits must be integrally

divisible by _7_ 

After all it explains all mentioned patterns like 9999999 and the well 

known 1111111.



I tried it with serials known to me - it always works!



Thank You and DR2000.

<BR>Windoze '95 <B>halves Your Download Speed</B>?<BR><BR>

If you access the Internet primarily

by dial-up connection, Win95 may

be holding you back... way back!<BR>

That's because, by default, Win95

optimizes some of its internal

Internet settings for LANs, and not

for modems. For example, Win95 normally sets an MTU

(Maximum Transmission Unit) packet size of 1500, an

Ethernet standard. But standard dial-up Internet

connections use a packet size of 576 bytes. The

packet-size mismatch can lead to needless slowdowns. If

you use your company's Ethernet LAN, leave MTU and

its related settings alone. But if you access via modem,

grab a free copy of Mike Sutherland's MTU-Speed applet

at <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=13 

HEIGHT=13 BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0><A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.mjs.u-net.com/mtuspeed/mtuspeed.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.mjs.u-net.com/mtuspeed/mtuspeed.htm'" tppabs="http://www.mjs.u-net.com/mtuspeed/mtuspeed.htm">http://www.mjs.u-net.com/mtuspeed/mtuspeed.htm</A>.<BR>

This nifty little utility lets you easily adjust MTU and

various other Registry settings that can affect dial-up

speed. Some users report their download speeds have

doubled after using the optimizations suggested by

MTU-Speed!<BR><BR>

Of course this kind of solution leave you still with a slow and buggy operating system... 

the real correct solution is <B>to cross over to Linux!</B>. And I don't know of anybody that 

went back to Windoze after having tried Linux...

<BR><BR>

<CENTER><TABLE border= "2" width=77%><TR><TD bgcolor="#FFFFEA"><CENTER><H3>Did you know that...</H3></CENTER></TD><TD><H2>(2)</H2></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<BR>

If you use Windoze's mail programs <B>people will complain that your messages arrive with gibberish or a

mysterious WINMAIL.DAT file</B>?<BR><BR>

M$-Mail has a feature that allows M$-Mail users to exchange

fully-formatted messages (fonts, italics, etc.), by attaching an RTF

(Rich Text Format) file to the message.  Another M$-Mail user will see

the formatted version, while any other email program will show the ASCII

message plus the attachment.  M$ made this option enabled by default, so

many M$-Mail users have no idea that they are annoying the rest of the 

world.

<BR><BR>

When Exchange thinks that it is sending mail to another Exchange user on 

the Internet, Exchange (more properly, the Internet Mail message service 

provider) encodes the message, along with attached files, embedded OLE 

objects, and their associated icons, into a special data block called the 

TNEF (pronounced tee-neff) block. This block encapsulates the complete 

original content of the Exchange message, so that the message arrives at 

its destination with all proper formatting intact, including boldface, 

underlining, fonts, and colors. Otherwise, Exchange formats the message 

in an Internet-standard fashion, discarding all rich text attributes and 

ensuring that all attached files appear as standard attachments. 

<BR><BR>

The problem arises when people not using Exchange or Outlook receive a 

message in the TNEF format: instead of seeing a formatted message, they 

see a big chunk of UUENCODE data if the sender used UUENCODE format, or 

a MIME body part application/ms-tnef if the sender used MIME. Depending 

on which mail program they use, they may either see a long sequence of 

hexadecimal digits, or they may see an attached binary file named 

WINMAIL.DAT. 

<BR><BR>

Here's how to turn it off:

Step #1:<UL><LI>

 Double-click on the Mail and Fax icon in Control Panel.

</LI><LI> Click on the Services tab, and select Internet Mail from the list. If

Internet Mail is not listed, click Add - add this service.

</LI><LI> Click Properties, and then Message Format.

 Turn off the option that reads Use MIME when sending messages.

</LI><LI> Click OK and then OK again.</LI></UL>

<BR>

Step #2:<UL><LI>

 Double-click on the name of each recipient in your Address Book.</LI>

<LI> Turn off the option that reads Always send to this recipient in

Micro$oft rich-text format.</LI>

<LI> This option needs to be set for each recipient of a message - if even

one has this turned on, all recipients will still get the attachment.</LI></UL>

<BR>

Note: Either of these methods should work for most users, but sometimes

nothing seems to work - yet another brilliant design strategy by M$.  I

you plan to be sending lots of internet email, you should seriously

consider using a mail program more suited to the task, such as Pegasus

or Eudora.

<BR><BR>

Note: A bug in Exchange may cause line feeds to be replaced with equal

signs when rich-text mail is disabled.<BR>

<BR>

So the best solution is actually to get rid of Outlook right now! (See below)

<BR> M$ Outlook's calendar shifts with time zone?<BR><BR>You will not believe this, yet it is true...<BR><BR>



You live in San Francisco and go to New York for business. You enter all

your business meetings in M$ Outlook's calendar on your windoze laptop

before you leave. You fly to New York and adjust your location (time zone)

so your computer will what time it is. Then you miss a crucial appointment

because the calendar claims a meeting is at 15:00 even though you said it was

at noon.

<BR><BR>

All your appointments get time shifted when you change your location. They 

claim this is a feature. I kid you not.

<BR><BR>

I can only guess that somebody decided appointments should be stored as GMT

and then displayed as local times depending on the time zone the computer

thinks it's in.

<BR><BR>

As to why they thought this was a good thing, I have no clue. (G.Marriot)

<BR> Excel changes numbers on its own?<BR>

<BR>If you enter a number, say 123456789999 in Excel and save the file as

comma delimited (*.csv format) it will be saved as 1.234567E+11.

Quite a few programs can't import this properly, including Word.

But what's worse, bringing it back into Excel gives you 123456700000.

I think the risks are fairly obvious.

I wonder if the large banks which have standardized on

Excel know about it... :-)

When opening an account therefore you not only do need to ask 

banks the interest rates, fees etc, but also what 

software they use. And avoid all those that use M$-programs!

<BR>Tou may update all win components to '98 WITHOUT giving much info to M$?<BR>

<BR>Korvus wrote a nice addition about M$'s stupidity<BR>

There's a nifty feature -for those of you that have Win98 already- at www.microsoft.com/windowsupdate that will allow you to update 

your windows components (if you call <U>that</U> updating :-)<BR>Unfortunately, you must 

register your copy of M$, including sending them all too much personal information. 

The scripts are quite simple to crack (so you can register as a 2 years old gardner from 

Nagorny-Karabak with five kids, two cows, three swimming pools and an income of three 

dollars per years, of course :-) and then remove the authorisation code and save it locally, 

but they keep changing the addresses, so you would keep continuously updating the page, 

which is boring to say the least...<BR>

So you better follow a completely different approach:<BR>

The entire authorization procedure is in a registry setting:<BR><B><FONT color=red>

<TABLE border= "2" width=77%><TR><TD bgcolor="#FFFFEA"><CENTER><H3>System administrators answering a troll</H3></CENTER></TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER>

<BR><BR>

<I>Well... soon or later I would have had to teach you how to fish info through clever 

placed trolls anyway, so learn it right now... (I'm just speaking for those among you that did 

not know this trick already, of course </I> :-)<I> ...Unix-related trolls (or Linux ones) on 

usenet can fetch a huge amount of interesting info, if cleverly placed.</I> 

<BR><BR><B>

This was the troll (first relevant part):</B>

<PRE>

&gt;&gt; I get this feeling that your anti-MS because your an old school UNIX weenie

&gt;&gt; that hates the fact of MS-NT eating your lunch with zero administration and

&gt;&gt; fast setup?

</PRE><BR><B>

This was a first answer:</B>

<PRE>

&quot;Zero Administration?&quot; ...Service packs that fix one problem while

introducing another.  Distributed in straight binary format with no

source code and no compiler, so you can't fix bugs in the code

yourself.  Changing simple things like IP settings requires a reboot.

Changing damn near anything requires a reboot.  On what's supposed to

be an Enterprise-class server?  The people that actually have to

administer NT systems usually _hate_ them.  Their boss is the one who

bought MS's bullshit about &quot;ease of use&quot; and &quot;reliability&quot;.

</PRE><BR><B>

This was the second answer (quite interesting, I believe)</B>

<PRE>

I can vouch for this somewhat, having to deal with an NT box at work,

although it's actually given us little trouble.  The reason for this

is that we have only *one* mission-critical function running on NT:

our <B>proxy</B> server.  The only other tasks it's used for are backing up

the network and file/application serving, neither of which would

cripple us if the box puked tomorrow.  The *real* important stuff runs

on Linux or Solaris (and, as soon as Informix ports its DB tools to

Linux, the Sun box will find itself on the doorstep the next day).



What slays me about Microsoft is how badly their software can coexist

with other products, *including their own*.  A classic example is

their aforementioned <B>Proxy</B> Server.  When you set up NT with the Option

Pack and Service Pack 3, it installs Internet Information Server 4.0

by default.  Which is fine, except for one small detail: it *breaks*

<B>Proxy</B> Server.  We had to back IIS 4.0 out of the system and install

IIS 3.0, which has no trouble working with <B>Proxy</B> Server.  AFAIK, there

is still no fix to get <B>Proxy</B> Server working properly with IIS 4.0.



Now tell me: if Microsoft can't be bothered to fix glaring

compatibility issues with its own products, what makes anyone think it

gives two shits about making them compatible with anyone else's?  Why

the hell did Sun sue Microsoft over the Java issue in the first place?

</PRE><BR><B>

Second part of the troll:</B>

<PRE>

&gt;&gt; UNIX hit rock bottom 2 years ago when the DOD shit canned it due to it high

&gt;&gt; cost. NT is cheaper and faster to use. Who in their right mind would spend

&gt;&gt; $1,500 for a crude UNIX OS when NT is better and almost $ 1,300 cheaper???

</PRE><BR><B>

First answer</B><PRE>



Well, why would you need to spend $1500 when you can get your pick of

various *BSD and Linux OS's for either the cost of the CD, or the time

it takes to download?  NT Server costs $200?  I think it's a bit more

than that.  And you also have to buy client licenses by the seat.  The

more workstations you have being served by NT, the greater the cost.

</PRE><BR><B>

Second answer</B>

<PRE>

He may be thinking of NT Workstation, which is a very different

animal.



Point of comparison: our upgrade to NT (we qualified, having run

Netware previously) cost us just under $1500 for the server and 30

client licenses (also not $200).  But Solaris is much, much more 

expensive, especially if you run it on SPARC hardware, although 

there are no client-access restrictions.

</PRE><BR><B>

I may add that they actually both realized they were answering to a troll, 

but, interesting enough, it worked nevertheless... and it was 

possible to fish out some anti-M$ info allright  :-)</B>
