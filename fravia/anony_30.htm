Better E-Mail Anonymity
<BR><BR>
Abstract:<BR>
==========<BR>
This essay adds to the basic knowledge gained from
+Fravia's introduction on 
his Anonymity pages.  The basics of SMTP and telnet
will be used to explain 
how to enhance anonymity.  My experiences with alias
creation will be 
referred to occasionally.
<BR><BR>
Introduction<BR>
=============<BR>
I will assume in this essay, most of what is contained
in +Fravia's own 
pages has been learned and applied (you have several
aliases, and several 
email accounts, not in your name).  This essay will
add to that knowledge to 
create a very powerful tool which for the sending
of ***very*** hard to trace email.
<BR><BR>
The first difficult task is finding a UNIX shell
account.  This may be done 
in two ways. One I know, the other I don't .  The way
I know invloves doing 
a search on the internet for
+free+UNIX+shell+accounts".  The kind you 
really, really want, have telnet access right away
without any verification 
process.  The other way is to steal it somehow, like
as in hacking the 
account of someone else (I've tried, and I haven't
been able to do this).  
Your goal should be to get as many accounts as you
can, even multiple 
accounts with the same provider.  Once you have your
accounts, pick one, and 
log in with telnet.
<BR><BR>
telnet<BR>
======<BR>
Telnet is probably one of the most important tools an
internet junkie can 
have.  Nearly every internet service devised can be
accessed with telnet and 
a knowledge of the protocol.  I will only talk about
it's uses in the 
current context of email and SMTP hosts. The protocol
we are interested in, 
is on TCP port 25.  It is called SMTP, or Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol.  
This is a text based<BR> protocol, and very simple to
learn.  A sample of the 
commands and steps required
to send mail is presented below and is fully
commented:
<PRE>
localhost$ telnet remote.host.net 25      /* open an SMTP connection         
                                   	  /* to remote.host.net
</PRE>
next, the connection banner will appear.  It will
describe the host, give 
some other information, and let the connecting process
know what the exact 
protocol is.  SMTP is good and ESMTP is not so good
(more later).
<BR><BR>
Once connected send the following:
<PRE>
helo any.server.com            /* let the SMTP host know who is              
                               /* calling

The host replies with something like:

Hello any.server.com, Pleased to meet you.  /* the SMTP host thinks          
                                    	    /* that is you

Then you send:

mail from: <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=any.name@any.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=any.name@any.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=any.name@any.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0">any.name@any.org</A>     /* this is the fake name

The host says:

502 sender ok &lt;<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=any.name@any.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=any.name@any.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=any.name@any.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0">any.name@any.org</A>&gt;...   /* this means your ok to go

Then you send:

rcpt to: <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=intended.recipient@intended.target.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=intended.recipient@intended.target.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=intended.recipient@intended.target.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0">intended.recipient@intended.target.org</A>  /* who you want it to       
                                            /* go to

The host says:
502 recipient ok
&lt;<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=intended.recipient@intended.target.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=intended.recipient@intended.target.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=intended.recipient@intended.target.org&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0">intended.recipient@intended.target.org</A>&gt;...   /* this 
     
                                        /* means its ok to go

Then you send:
data				/* let the host know this is the              
                                /* message part of the message
Subject: Gotta have a subject   /* put a subject in
then you type away              /* now type your message
.                               /* when you are done,
put a  .  on a line all by itself

The host responds with:
502 ok, message sent
</PRE>
You did it, you have just sent an anonymous faked email.
<BR><BR>
TCP Port 25 Protocols<BR>
========================<BR>
In my not so extensive experience, there are two main
protocols alive on 
port 25.  These are SMTP and ESMTP.  When using email
manually, for 
anonymity purposes as we are, the best protocol to
find is SMTP.  ESMTP has 
the ability to actually track where you are coming
from,
and SMTP does not.  ESMTP may even be able to verify
the "mail from:" 
address in some cases.  Also, many ESMTP hosts do not
relay.  SMTP works 
best for our purposes.
<BR><BR>
Finding an SMTP host is simple, but time consuming. 
Search, search and 
search.  Try out domains from other email messages you
have seen, try out 
random sites, try out sites you have done other stuff
at.
<BR><BR>
Putting it All Together<BR>
==========================<BR>
Now to put this all together, in conjunction with
+Fravia's own discussion 
on email anonymity.  Log in to your first telnet
account, then telnet into 
the next from that, and so on, until you have no more
accounts left to 
telnet into.  Then telnet into smtp.host.com port 25
(as in +Fravia's web 
page), and send your anonymous message using the given
guidelines to 
<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=remailer@replay.com&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=remailer@replay.com&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/ym/Compose/?To=remailer@replay.com&YY=11500&order=down&sort=date&pos=0">remailer@replay.com</A>, and using the SMTP protocol.
Admittedly, this is quite 
paranoid, so you can tame it down to any extent you
desire.
<BR><BR>
The benefits of this approach are the nearly
impossible to track ip 
addresses, and all traceable telnet accounts are not
in your own name. You 
also have complete control over the message.
<BR><BR>
The drawbacks are the time spent connecting, and you
still need to connect 
to the internet somehow,  which may eventually result
in an ip address 
tracked to your computer.

Script Dump<BR>
============<BR>
Below is a script dump of a session I just had.  My ip
address according to 
Winsock is 207.195.xxx.xxx, note the ip address
reported by ESMTP Sendmail.  
Also note that for security my own ip, user name and
sending address have 
been altered in some way, while the integrity of the
rest of the information 
may be deemed as intact.  Comments are denoted by /*
