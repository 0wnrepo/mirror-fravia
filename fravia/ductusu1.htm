<H3>Example 2: Landlord vs Tenant: a "text-exegesis" crack</H3>

<BR>

by VK , with a small exegesis addition by fravia+<BR>

21 September 1998

<HR></CENTER>

Fravia+, having read your "surreality cracking" <A href="necrophi.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/necrophi.htm">paper</A> today I send you a

"real surreal" example of my own. I actually attempted text-cracking

this letter a few days ago when I received it (yes it is a real

letter). It was only today that I read your surreality paper - it was

only today that you published it. I consider this a far simpler

example than your own, but it surely is an example of a, as you say

<I> "ductus subtilis, where the Author simulates an opinion ... with a

concealed aim ... to obtain in his audience a quite different

effect."</I> In this particular example I consider that this is

attempted largely by means of the structure as opposed to content.

Here I first set the scene - this document must be understood within

it's wider context - followed by the document and my own text-exegesis 

comments.



<HR WIDTH=30%><H2>CONTEXT</H2>

<BR><BR>

This is the third occasion that my landlord has attempted

to evict me from my

rented home and I've previously employed solicitors to fight these

actions. My defence is fairly complex as it's a legal

argument, and the court

date for the possession hearing is now nine or ten days away.

<P>

I have replied to the court summons stating that the notices seeking

possession are not valid for reasons that don't need to be detailed 

here. This letter arrives after

the court has sent a copy of my defence to these 'solicitors'.

<HR>

<H2>TEXT</H2><BR><BR>

The letter reads

<P>

Dear Sirs,

<P>

RE: MY LANDLORDS FULL NAME - V - MY NAME<BR>

CASE NO: AB12345

<P>

Recently we received a cheque in an envelope without any covering

letter. The cheque is for £52.00 dated 26 September 1998 issued by

Abbey National and it is payable D.Gordon and gives the reference

number VK/Gordon. You must appreciate that there are several people

working in this office and we have got a number of files. We would ask

you that in future if you send any cheque or any document to this

office you should send a covering letter making it clear that it

originates from you and with which particular case or file you are

sending the name of the parties and also stating exactly why you are

sending that document or cheque. If you do not follow the procedure

which we have described then we regret that we may not know for what

purpose the document or cheque has been sent.

<P>

We note your reply to possession is silent whether you agree or

disagree with the arrears of rent set out in the Particulars of Claim.

Would you please let us know whether you agree with the figures. In

case you disagree with the figures then please explain why and how

much amount you admit.

<P>

In the reply you say "payment of rent were initially delayed in order

to force the landlord to carry out essential repairs". We hereby

require you to supply us with details of each and every essential

repair you are referring there, exactly what was (inserted manually

<B>in</B>) disrepair<S>ed</S> and when you reported it to the landlord

and when the work was carried out.

<P>

Yours faithfully,

<P>

<B>BOZO SOLICITOR</B>

<P>

<H2>Exegesis</H2>

<BR><BR>

It is extremely important to consider this document in it's context.

Although I am very concerned about this court case to evict me next

week, I know that really they are unlikely to succeed and I expect

that they will pull out at the last moment so that the court case does

not happen. This is what has happened on 2 previous occasions and they

have not got a case against me. Even if it goes to court, I have got

another defence which I have not yet disclosed;

<P>

What first struck me about this document is the <B>absolute CRAP</B>

that is that first paragraph. It is total nonsense - they had a

reference and my name as drawer of the cheque, paid to my landlord. It

got me thinking - <B>Why are they writing this crap?</B>. The answer

is that they are deliberately trying to unsettle me. Then I noticed

that the last paragraph is also fairly hostile - "We <FONT

color=red>hereby require you ... </FONT> This is especially relevant

as I know that withholding rent to force the landlord to carry out

repairs is not a defence to not paying the rent - and even these crap

solicitors should know that. From there it was fairly easy - it's that

central paragraph that they are really after.

<P>

I can see that they are keen to trap me into admitting that I owe a

certain amount of rent (probably about £2,800) because otherwise they

probably have no chance of getting it from me.

<P>

There's more to this analysis. O.K. it's fairly clear that they are

from a different cultural background, but are they playing on that for

their own advantage? Of course they are. They are acting dumb, hoping

that I am racist, so that I consider them to be stupid as a racist

would and slip up and give them what they want. Prospective solicitors

would have to have a minimal standard of competence in English before

anyone would accept them for training (and I would expect that to

apply in India too). I am not at all impressed by this because it does

not show any originality or creativity - I think of it as their

habitual way of conducting themselves. 

<P>

There is more. They are also trying to catch me by using a command

from authority. The first paragraph is like a scolding from a child's

parents. They have had to search for something to be able to do this -

and what they found is far too poor. The last paragraph is similar but

also asserts authority over me - they are telling that I must conform

to their authority. I consider this very powerful as they are trying

to get me to perform a certain action. By performing that action I

would be submitting and accepting their authority. Then they would

have real power over me. There is also the danger that by replying to

that request, I would also slip-up and give them what they want.

I think you should also note the 'reasonable argumentation' tone: the 

wording between 

<FONT color=purple>You must

appreciate</FONT> and <FONT color=purple>we regret that we may not</FONT> 

acquires a sort of 'logical' might on its own.<BR>

There's also a rhetorical figure known as epitrope, here (or <I>permissio</I>): 

the Author is trying to imply that the path chosen by the reader will not 

serve the 'real' interests of the reader himself, reversers should note 

that this is a typical form 

of the <I>simulatio</I>, where an Author always fakes complete innocence and 

neutrality of 

intentions in order to deceive his reader (getting him rhetorically 

off-balance). The whole piece is 

a classical example of <I>syntaxis obliqua</I> a grammatical scheme to hyde 

semanthically important snippets inside background syntaxis, as VK correctly 

states.

Awaiting your corrections/contributions/ameliorations...
