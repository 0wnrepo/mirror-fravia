Well I remember a beautiful essay by Frog's print about 

something related with steganography: Watermarking of digital images, here it is:

                   Commercial stupidity - Digimarc downfall</a> where you'll be able 

to see how easy it is to reverse some 'very heavy' (and expensive) watermarking 

commercial 

applications, like Digimarc. If you are interested in Watermarking problems, you'll find on 

the web watermarking tools and tools to 'unwatermark' images (like Unzign and Stirmark).

I'll add here more essays as soon as you start writing them. Some short essays about 

advanced steganographical 

cracking (cracking of the steganographocal algorithms themselves of course, not 

of the software programs to perform steganography, which, as you will see, are all

 either not at all or ridicously protected :-) are or will be asap 

in the 'advanced steganography' page of mine (see below).<br>Of course we are

 a little 'cheating' here. In order to crack at ease you'll get the ORIGINAL 

image used as carrier (something you won't get in real life) and I have used 

very easy password options, as you'll see.

<hr><font size="+2">Reasons for this section

</font><br>     

<i>Well, I have received so many questions about steganography, after having written 

inside my revamped <a href="noanon.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/noanon.htm">anonymity academy</a> page the 

following...</center></i><pre>

Morale: keep your sensitive data ON THE WEB somewhere where nobody 

in his right mind would ever look, nor understand them even if he did 

(say steganographed inside the dull images of a bogus page like &quot;me 

and my little dog Barkie&quot; :-) they will be MUCH more safe there than 

inside your own harddisk!</pre><i><center>...that I realized that many among my readers 

don't even know the most elementary basic of hiding (and/or retrieving hidden) 

data on the web and elsewhere... <br>Yet hiding (and retrieving hidden :-) data 

is a VITAL question, on the web and in life, 

when so many people are 

continuously (and increasingly) trying to get their hands on your money/convinctions/future 

through your data, using all known 

tricks of the books (and some less known ones as well, as +ORC explains in his <a href="slaves.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/slaves.htm">slaves 

of the supermarkets</a> famous essay... btw there are some passages about 

steganography itself in his &quot;6&quot; lessons, if 

I'm not mistaken)<br> 

So, dear reader, just do what you're supposed to do anyway: READ! In fact I believe 

you better read <u>and 

head</u> the following, and then start your own studies on this matter as soon 

as you'll be able to.<br>Unfortunately, for 

once, this time I will and cannot explain too much publicly (because I'm actually 

using 

myself quite a lot of the tricks I have to describe) yet I want to explain everything 

nevertheless: the whole idea of my site is that knowledge should be passed on to 

anybody who cares... but i need a 'sieve' in order to see if you really care... I 

have taken the idea from 

+ORC's famous gates, and it works!.<br>Hope you'll understand me: lamers 

and leechers <u>must</u> be 

kept somehow away, at least for a little while, else they will immediately start 

using the same tricks 

'en masse' for some stupid purpose and spoil the game for me and all other 

real +crackers around.<br><br>

So this page is and will remain only a 'start' platform. Don't be deceived! 

You'll get on this very page enough information to 

make you happy, and you will be able to deepen it and work on it at leisure 

(and this page <u>will be updated</u>, and you'll always find a lot here)... yet you 

WILL NOT get to the advanced steganography page, unless you crack the BMP and GIF 

images that you'll find on this page.<br><br>

This should sieve lamers and leechers out, I hope.</i><br><br>

<font size="+2">Purpose of the sieve</font><br>

The sieve has another purpose: to teach you how to reverse the algorithms used by 

the main steganographical  applications (admittely using the softer forms of 

encryption allowed, in order to 'offer you the throat' for your attacks :-)<br>You see: 

this is a reverse engineering site (may be THE reverse engineering 

site :-) and 

you'll therefore now begin to use some of the techniques that you 

have learned reversing and cracking 

software in order to proceed further.<br><br>

Yes. You won't be able to go further without having studied (at least a little), 

+ORC's tutorial and his students' essays, in other words: you need to know (at least a 

little) how to reverse engineer software in order to understand many other aspects 

of the web, inter alia steganography (but I think you'll be thankful that you did learn 

our techniques: I reckon that this is more and more useful 

regarding life in general as well... without reverse engineering knowledge you are only 

a Guinea pig for the commercial slaughtering powers of our disgusting 

society). So let's start cracking, and working, and getting onwards...<br>

Let's not forget what +ORC wrote:<br>

<font color="purple">&quot;...I need your knowledge 

<u>as much</u> as you need mine, so build some and start contributing...&quot;</font><br>

right so! And this applies here as well, 

you'll therefore have to perform some 'applied steganographical cracking':<br><br> 

An <a href="#anchorefs">easy first step</a> (I will use as 'bait' some secret locations on the web) 

where you'll have to crack either the algos used by CONTRABAND (version 9g) for BMPs images

 or those used by 

Hide and seek (version 4.1) for GIF's images.

<br><br>

A <a href="#anchorass">less easy second step</a> (I will use as 'bait' the location 

of the 'advanced steganography page').

Here you'll have to crack the algos used for BMP files 

by Steganos for windows 95 (version 1.0a).<br><br>

Ah yes, a last thing: as images I'll use only Tamara de Lempicka's pictures... you may not be excused for not knowing 

her paintings and this will remind you that 

there are other things to reverse in life (like culture, duh :-)

FRAVIA'S 

STEGANOGRAPHY STARTING PAGE</font></center>

<br><br>

The word steganography is derived from greek and means &quot;coverted writing&quot;, from 

stegein, to cover... the same root as in Stegosaur, a quadrupedal, herbivorous 

ornithiscian dinosauar of Jurassic films and early Cretaceous times, well 

known for being quite 'covered' through an armor of triangular bony plates on 

his back spine.<br>

<br>

Steganography is the art (and science) of communicating hiding THE EXISTENCE of 

communication, in contrast with cryptography. Ideally, your enemies, or the one 

you are fighting against, or even your friends, should not even imagine 

that there IS a message 

concealed somewhere.<br>This very characteristic makes steganography the IDEAL 

science for hiding messages on the web, which is flooded by non-significant 

data. Your whole passwords and everything you need can without any problem be 

hidden inside three or four 'fake' pages you'll have uploaded somewhere, with 

images like 'my sister Sally and his favourite banana fishes' or whatever.<br>You 

will download all fake images from the web (geocities page are a never ending source 

of incredibly dull lifes and fotographies :-), you will MODIFY them (the greatest 

risk for steganography is the confrontration between 'original' image without 

concealed message and steganated image with message, of course), and only after 

these modifications you will hide your concealed message inside them with one of 

the many programs that you'll find around.<br><br>

Basically, using steganography, you can smuggle any file(s) over any 

communication-line (BBS, network, modem, diskmail, etc.) in a format 

which leaves the smuggled data untraceable and unreadable.<br><br>



Here you have a link to my own copy of a <u>BMP</u> graphic format stegonograpical

general I love working with programs (and <u>onto</u> programs) I have the source 

code of. In fact, I like it so much that if I really use a program and do not have 

the source code I re-create it myself reversing the whole bazaar, or at least 

the parts I need or fancy to change...<br>I'm sure therefore that you'll 

appreciate the presence of the source code for BOTH programs, this will allow you 

to delve pretty deep inside all mysteries and vagaries of our applied and 

advanced stegonography.<br>You may find A LOT 

more UNIX source code <a href="#anchorsour">here</a><br><br>

<a name="anchorefs"></a>

<hr><font size="+3">Now try cracking these images! (a first easy step)</font><br><br>

I will give you a &quot;bait&quot; in order to pull your reversing capacities, Let's start with 

a bmp image... you'll have to perform here an (easy) crack of CONTRABAND (version 9g)<br>

<br>

Here you have <u>two</u> zipped bmp(s) images with a famous picture from 

Tamara de Lempicka: Andromeda. You may download the <img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="13" ALT="red"><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/_ndrom.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/_ndrom.zip'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/_ndrom.zip">original</a> 

andromeda and the <img SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" HEIGHT="13" WIDTH="13" ALT="red"><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/androm.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/androm.zip'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/androm.zip">stegonated</a></font> andromeda.

<br><br>

Both images have been zipped (from bmp format)<br>Unzip them and have a look.<br>

You wont spot any differences, yet inside the <u>second one</u> I have 

hidden -using contraband- a small text file: secfiles.txt which was only 

587 bytes long.<br>

Inside secfiles.txt, if you ever reverse it 'out' of the BMP image, you'll 

be able to find 

a LIST OF SOME SECRET LOCATIONS of files on the Web, files that you may 

find interesting and locations which are not given 

anywhere else inside my sites.<br>

I'm sure that you will probably enjoy some of those files... well, you 

won't get them unless you crack the stegonated bmp picture above :-)<br><center>

<hr><font size="+3">Now try cracking these images! (a second easy run)</font><br><br>

I'll offer another run -this time in gif format- to the reversing capable among my readers:

Here you have two copies of the famous Andromeda by Tamara de Lempicka:<br>

<br>

<img SRC="bigandr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bigandr.gif" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="480"></a> ~ 

<img SRC="outfile.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/outfile.gif" WIDTH="320" HEIGHT="480"></a><br>the <font color="blue">original</font> 

Andromeda and the '<font color="blue">stegonated</font>' Andromeda</center>. 



This time you have the two GIF images above, and the same file as above (587 bytes 

long) has been 

hidden inside  

the 'stegonated' GIF using hide and seek version 4.1.<br>

I used a very short and easy to crack (4 numbers) 

encryption key (the same used for the 'contraband' bmp(s) above, by the way), so it's a 

very easy brute force attack, yet you can crack this in a more 'zen' way, as you'll see, 

later, when you arrive to my advanced steganography page.

<br>

Inside secfiles.txt, if you ever reverse it 'out' of the GIF image, you'll find 

a LIST OF SOME SECRET LOCATIONS of files on the Web, locations 

which are not given anywhere else inside my sites.<br>

<br><br>

Well... crack this one instead of the previous one, if you prefer :-)



<br><br>

<hr>

Come on... you should manage it... and anyway I believe you'll find it a 

worthy approach to steganographycal cracking!<br>

Inside the steganographed images above you'll NOT find as an added bonus 

the location of my 

'advanced steganography academy' pages, which are NOT linked from my 'common' 

sites, nor dwell on this server. You'll find some 'secret' files, tough, as I said, 

and you'll find it relatively EASY to crack. In order to reach my advanced 

steganography pages you'll have to crack the two BMP pictures at the BOTTOM 

of this page.

<br>See you there!<br>

<i>And Fabian was not the only one (nor the first one :-) to have reacted immediately 

along these lines... OK, so I lied when I published the first version of this page, back 

in 1997... in fact I put only the 'secret files' inside the stegonated Andromeda picture, 

therefore you'll find no secret URL for an 'advanced steganography page' there (but 

I believe you will enjoy some of those files nevertheless)... mea 

culpa: I 

was not quick enough, and pleasingly surprised by your fast answers!!<br> 

The (not at all sad :-) fact is 

that (many among) my readers are TOO QUICK! You already cracked everything 

before I had a chance to prepare 'as it should' my 'advanced steganography page... yet that page begins to be ready now. So you'll now 

be able to start roaming using that &quot;coveted&quot; URL.<br>

But, since it was such an easy cracking, with my 'Andromedas' above, I'll push up the 

ante! You will have to work a 

little more (do not complain! You are all here for the sake of cracking, aren't you?)

<br>Here follows ANOTHER couple of a Tamara de Lempicka's picture, original and stegonated, in

enclosed the URL of my advanced page inside the stegonated one.<br>

<font color="blue">New add_on: 2 January 1998</font><br>

Advanced steganography URL (and password) have changed! (Password above was too easy)

<hr width="66%"><font color="blue">December_help</font>

<br>Some help 

information: I have used very small images, a password still with 8 

simple (yet no more extremely simple) alfabetic chars and no numbers 

nor punctuation signs, the 

hidden text is only an ASCII url, 36 bytes long (which has the following 

form: <fontr color="red">http://*.htm</font>).<br>Moreover I have 

used BMP images with very <u>few</u> colours... something you should NEVER do 

if you stegonate for true.<br>Hint: try using yourself the various options of Fabian's 

Steganos on the original image...<br>

Well, you have your chance, now crack! :-)<br><br>

<font color="blue">New_year's_add_on_help</font><br> Should the server given in the hidden URL <u>not</u> 

answer, (could happen, particularly during holydays) there is <u>another</u> 

server of mine with the SAME <font color="red">name_you_have_to_find.htm</font> 

 advanced steganography page, a 'second copy' that is, so you may as well access it there... once you find the name and 

have learned how to finger and NSLookup servers, an important and easy technique which 

you should master anyway)

<hr width="66%"><font size="+2">Now try cracking these images! (a second easy run)</font>

<br>'s-tools version 4.00, by Andy Brown)<br><br>

 I'll offer another run -this time in gif format- to the reversing capable among my readers: Here you have two copies of

                          another famous picture by Tamara de Lempicka:



<br>

<img SRC="tdlslee.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tdlslee.gif" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="234"></a> 

<img SRC="stegslee.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/stegslee.gif" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="234"></a><br>the <font color="blue">original</font> 

asleep girl and the '<font color="blue">stegonated</font>' one<br> 

<br>

This time you have the two GIF images above, and the same 

text file as above (36 bytes 

long) has been 

hidden inside  

the 'stegonated' GIF using s-tools 4, by Andy Brown may be the 

best of the tools around. You can download it 

right <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/s-tools4.zip  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/s-tools4.zip'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/s-tools4.zip">HERE</a> on my site.<br> 

<br>

I used the same key used for the 'steganos' bmp(s) above, by the way), so it's 

up to you how to devise an attack, you can crack this in a more 'zen' way, 

as you'll see.

<br>

Inside adva.txt, if you ever reverse it 'out' of the GIF image, you'll find 

the URL of the advanced steganography page<br>

<hr width="66%">

OK, OK, so you find this too difficult, yet I want you to be able to crack s-tools 

algos as well and not only steganos... so... here once more two SMALL images, in gif format: the same 36 bytes 

long adva.txt file is hidden inside, the same 8 characters password has been used, 

the option chosen have been, once more, IDEA and attempt to lower number of colours...

well, I think you should have enough data now... crack!<br>

Well... crack this one instead of the previous one, if you prefer :-)

<hr size="4">

<center> Here you have, as 'teaser' my own comments to Fabian's essay:<br> 

<i>Well, for once I'm hosting an essay of a person that does not use handles 

nor avatars nor nicknames: Fabian Hansmann, the Author of Steganos, one of 

the most interesting Stenographical applications on the scene. His idea of using 

a benign virus in order to spread noise is interesting, yet not new (some 

+masters have already prepared long ago a 'benign' cracking virus -antibil7.com- 

that registers Micro$oft's timelimited targets WITHOUT NOTICING the owner 

of the PCs where these targets are found :-)<br>

So Fabian's idea can be implemented if needs be, 

moreover we will of course begin ourselves, 

during 1998, to 'deepen' (in a reversing sense) our knowledge of the whole 

steganographical existing bazaar... and I'm happy that we'll work hand in hand 

with steganographical experts (and nette Leute) like Fabian (and maybe 

other Authors as well as it seems).

<br>

Another hint<br>

Here you have as teaser a 'light' version of Jean Flynn's essay (that you will find 

complete on the advanced page): <a href="fly___01.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/fly___01.htm">A Journey within Steganos</a>, 

you should be able to figure out the advanced page entrance reading this... that is, 

if you work a little :-)
