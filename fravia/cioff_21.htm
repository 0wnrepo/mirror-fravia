<H2>Reality cracking tools: H. Cioff's suggestions</H2>

25 November 1998<BR>

<HR>Courtesy of fravia's pages of reverse engineering ~  Slightly edited by fravia+<BR><BR>

<I>Well, 'firm for facts' is an even better allitteration, yet H.Cioff is quite right (apart from 

his beer-related footnotes menaces, he probably just never tasted the beer quintessence: <I>Ename triple</I>): "<FONT color=purple>Reality cracking is so important that it should have a (completely open and transparent but) unambiguous  terminology, quite

distinct from the language of politicians</FONT>". Yeah, quite right... yet I still would like some more 

practical beef and less taxonomical theory :-)<BR>Somehow I don't believe that 

the links to the pharmaceutical industry's 

international gossip magazine, though VERY interesting are 'beefy' enough for a 'normal' 

reader... unless Cioff himself (or somebody else) 

does not care to explain "the up and the downs" -in a reversing sense- of that specifical sector. I'll make an easy example. Though I knew 

from the beginning that my chances of winning a lottery are rather slim, I never realized, before 

learning +Atheist's unsurpassed essay <A href="ath_sta1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ath_sta1.htm">Statistical cracking: basics: cracking lotteries</A> that 

there is a PURPOSELY spread of lotteries all over the world in order to STEAL money from 

the gullible ones. So, you see, that's 'reality cracking beef' IMNSHO. But Cioff's essay is -of course- 

jolly worth 

publishing as it is, and those among us that will follow his links in order to consider  

(and delve a little inside) the  pharmaceutical industry's 

ugly deeds will find this really worth it... in order to defend themselves and us all</I>

<H1>Reality cracking tools: Cioff's suggestions</H1>

<P>I believe, dear reader, that we agree on the need of reality reversal. So it is

inhibitory to our real purpose to use too much energy in deepening and

extending our understanding of the need. This could wait until we need

to recruit more members of the Reversing Society. I think there is

homework to be done before that.



<P>It is my impression that you may be more analytically tempered than

I in matters relating to the real world. I may be more impatient -

maybe I have fewer years to do it? Fravia+ wants more from me on marketing.

I will give some to you, but in a secondary context. Doing too much

primary work in that direction now would lose time for us in more

urgent matters. Most people don't mind about mass marketing, so

reversing it will be soooooooo slow. As I said in my previous essay:

If we go for the less sophisticated industries first, a lot of simple

people may get hurt. Let's take the big ones first of all, that's where the

challenges are. And the nice tools. Some toolboxes are out

there, rewarding to be found and cracked. Some other ones must be invented.



<P>I believe we should start working on more advanced tools and start

having real debates, not only about beers (I really would need a

footnote here, but I abstain 0|8--)

<BR><BR>

AND, dare I say it: <B>Field tests</B>. If we really are among the few survivors of

the Age of Reason (those not taken over by the thistledown emotionality of

the politicians or the popular press, or the general cowardice of

organisation and corporation inmates), I think we should stand <U>firm on

facts</U> (nice alliteration, don't you think?).

<H3>First we must make ourselves some ideas and plans</H3>

<P>I have some suggestions. But so have others. How about a

competition? Best reversing <FONT color=blue>projects</FONT> Authors  

will earn a reversed question mark in

front of their names. ?Cioff - looks nice, doesn't it? (You pronounce

it "Cioff?")

<H3>These ideas must be tried out scientifically.</H3> 

<P>In practice: We could state a hypothesis, give an experimental

setting, and try to find

quantifyable variables to study. We could start quite simply. I can

list a few experiments, but again I abstain.

<P>I'm not sure yet how we should set up the experimental protocol.

Could

we discuss it? Internet social science and computer activism FUSION

project?

<BR>&nbsp;

<H3>Hurting Muckrosoft</H3>

<P>If we are going to hurt Meekrosoft, we should start doing the Oryx

Orca (the North Atlantic Killer Whale) thing: Eat into the fat of the

slow and stupid plankton-eating whale (the oceanic variety of the

cow). Could it be an idea to launch a 

Debian-for-beginners-who-are-a-little-afraid-of-taking-the-big-step-out-of-the-long-Win-Doze

workshop on Fravia+' pages? Explain step-by-step -for instance- how to migrate to Linux 

for dummies. Get 100000 clever ones, per day,  

 bidding farewell to Gates... If successful such a move could REALLY hurt µ$, and

strengthen all GNU (I suppose GNU are friends)



<H3>Reversing tools</H3>

Of other reality reversing tools I would like to develop a vocabulary.

Unlike you I have no classical education, just a technical one. I'm

not very good in

languages, either. But we need specific words apart from the

technicalities of Softice.



<P>Reality cracking

<BR>Reality reversing

<BR>Reality inverting

<BR>Reality perverting

<BR>Reality polluting

<BR>Reality obscuring

<BR>Reality spoofing or faking



<P>Just for a start. Maybe all the words are useless, maybe not.

Anyone could come up with a list of other words to be taken care of. I

come along with these suggestions because I'm not sure I have

understood the difference between reality cracking and reality

reversing - unless cracking is breaking the code, i.e. understanding,

and reversing is planning to or actually implementing improvements in

the code. We need a common and simple code if we have the ambition of

doing mass reversal. Reversing the world!?



<P>Reality cracking is so important that it should have a (completely

open and transparent

but) unambiguous&nbsp; terminology, quite distinct from the language

of politicians. I think we must keep politics - as up to now - more

than an arm's length away. 



<P>I also must put on the brakes a little on the top-down reality

cracking

or reversing. The top-down reality cracker or reverser must not be seen

as such. Obscurity is the best way to stay in office. Schindler saved

some Jews. von Stauffenberg was executed. 



<P>Another very important matter: If we go for the top-down stealth

option (not you or me - but we can support those why go for it 8--) )

we should calculate a net yield of less than 5 percent. Most will

defect when they have reached office because they are rewarded for

changing sides, or see the keeping of their convictions as a too

expensive luxury. Only those with nothing to lose... or with so much all 

their life long that they don't care... Go for those

with the well-educated and well-paid wives (or husbands), go for those 

lucky enough that they give for granted -and yet don't like- 

the 'affluent society they live in! Go for 'noble' (in a knowledge sense, 

of course) and despise 'vulgar' (in a knowledge sense, 

of course) ones!



<P>I'm so thrilled by this because I see your efforts and quite a few

others as a restoration of generosity in this world of greed. I

believe there must be donors around if the world is going to be put

right. Important for quality, important for productivity, important

for innovation. And the donors must be middle-aged or old men. You'll seldom 

find the young there: They have mostly nothing to give away, but struggle hard

to establish themselves. It can't be -mostly- the women 

either (I'll try to explain you

why with anorther essay, in the mean time I would love it if 

some girl would show me that I'm wrong). So it must be the

"middle-age plus" men, the 'clever seniores' 

with a career of learning or teaching already behind them, so they have

experience and real knowledge to give away. (most of them are not

generous, but cling to their knowledge to gain power over others, or

are well-adapted cowards, some of them have lost any illusion about life, 

democracy or politics, and 

are just trying the last tricks in the box in a desperate attempt to change things).

<H3>Reality reversing tools</H3>

<P>The best of all sources about the pharmaceutical industry is the

international gossip magazine Scrip, which is published twice weekly,

and is updated online. I have access to a paper subscription, so I'm

unstalkable there. I've never been at the Web sites.

<P>But even though it is an invaluable source, you should read the

conditions of sale. 

<P>Their conditions for sale are (1 & 2 are rather strict copyright

notices). Points 3 and 4: may interest you more:

<P>3.That it will not be circulated without prior agreement with the

publisher outside the staff who work at the address to which it is sent.

<P>4. An order for additional copies at reduced rates constitutes as

undertaking by the subscriber that such copies will not be exported or

distributed so as to avoid taking full price subscriptions elsewhere

without prior agreement with Scrip."

<P>And then the annual subscription prices: Europe: £615 (UK £535) -

(380 and 320, respectively, for additional copies in the same envelope).

<P>I can imagine that a fair number of people who cannot afford it

would love to see the meat of these sites. Would Fravia+' Web

searching methods work for these sites?

<P>

I consider this as a possible beginning for the tools section of the

big reversing effort. Other industries must have similar tools, I

suppose. Who dares be the next?
