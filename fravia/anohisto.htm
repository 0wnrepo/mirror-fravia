<BR><BR><A name="son"></A>

<B>Thou shallt not sacrifice thy son! (How many beers drank Gerhard Schr–der last Saturday?)</B><BR>

Don't ever think that anonimity is just an 'Internet' stuff. Make a small experiment (I did it).

Use your real address and the real name of your 4-years old son and book one of those

Reader's Digest (or whatever) bogus advertisement. Of course never pay for anything, let it

just die out. The interesting thing happens after a short while: your letterbox begins to

be filled with OTHER advertisement and ads-campaigns directed to your son. They have passed the

data around.<BR>

This is a common practice among the bastards: they integrate reciprocally their databases with

the most complete possible data about you (and if you use one of those 'super-advantage'

supermarket

cards they will know also how oft you cry ~ go to the toilet ~ sleep ~ wash your teeth and so

on).

<BR>

Another example: 'outsourcing' means that many data that you believe you are giving to your

doctor ~ insurer ~ railway company ~ rent-a-car society ~ frequent flyer schema (and so on)

are in reality elaborated by just ONE huge (mostly american) company (let's say Electronic Data

System just to make a name :-) don't think the amis will really need a lot of

CIA to know exactly how many beers the German Chancellor (or whoever else)

drinks on Saturday...<BR><BR><A name="read"></A>

<B>How quick do you read what? (Ever wondered why there are free email services?)</B><BR>

On the web you leave a lot of traces,

as you'll be able to see <FONT color=red>[</FONT><A href="whatdika.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/whatdika.htm">here</A><FONT

color=red>]</FONT>, every server

you are using to access the web has an IP-address that will be logged together with exact

information about WHATEVER YOU DO on a page. Yes: how long you looked at it, where did you

come from, which links you clicked onto and so on... there are some (weak) counter measures

that you can take see <FONT color=red>[</FONT><A href="ideale7.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideale7.htm">here</A><FONT

color=red>]</FONT>, but

overall it would be fairly easy to understand exactly what your real

interests are if deemed necessary. Now, you'll say, noone is going to go after me! Nice attitude,

you'r not Paranoid, yet this does not mean that they are not interested in your data

nevertheless.  The data you are smearing around <B>are</B> collected, because they are

useful <I>per se</I> or, more often, because they MIGHT be useful if inserted in a data

mainstream. Did

you ever wonder WHY there are free email-services on the web? I see the light of understanding

sparkling inside

your eyes... yes! The sheer amount of data that can be gathered through somebody as huge as

AOL (or somebody as visited as Altavista) is incredibly interesting for data evaluation, data

merchandising, targeted advertising, insider trading and even maybe for simple

denunciation (or collaboration) purposes with the power that be. In systems like ours, µ

where the

political oligarchy is

elected by the small part of the population that care to vote, mostly on the base of some

televisive crap or on the basis of some "info" that has been obviously concocted by

their very masters for personal gain purposes,

the sheer POWER that the abovementioned data can represent gives me the creeps. Forget

obsolete means like the "Bild-Zeitung" or "the Sun",

the new methods to control the slaves are much more refined.

<B>Email tracking and PGP</B><BR>



As you can learn <FONT color=red>[</FONT><A href="enemy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/enemy.htm">elsewhere</A><FONT

color=red>]</FONT> on my site, it is relatively easy (if time-consuming) to track

an email (even if forged). Not only does the header itself, mostly, deliver quite

exact information about the provenience of the mail (IP-path and timezones), but all

server through which the email went have gathered all traces onto

their own loggings, with the exact message-ID of the email that you are targeting.

That's how spammers and small trollers are caught, btw. Here you go with some ID-examples of

a single email I have received to-day (as you all can see through the timestamps

it went from the States to the European Union early this morning)<HR>

When stalking this specific target you would use the

Message-Id: <B><U><FONT color=red>&lt;199812080508.GBA11095@hydra.accu.uu></FONT></U></B>

performing your queries to the various servers, in order to check their loggings...



Since email is passed around IN CLEAR, you would be well advised to ROUTINELY USE PGP. I know

that

I myself am not following this advice nearly often enough, yet I believe I'll begin to do

it soon. The level to which the automated email sniffers have arrived is getting quite

disturbing. <BR>

So send your mail encrypted with PGP.  It's simpler as you may fear.

Set a 4096 bit encryption if you'r truly parano.

NOBODY cracks this! (1024 bit is considered Military Grade)   Not the

NSA, certainly not some wannabe electronic PIs.  How powerful is PGP?

Hear: "<FONT color=purple>If all the personal computers in the world -260 million- were put to

work

on a single PGP-encrypted message, it would still take an estimated 12

million times the age of the universe, on average, to break a single

message</FONT>" (Crowell, Deputy Director of the National Security Agency, in March 1997.

<BR>



Fact is PGP won't be cracked by any brute-force attack.  Not in your

lifetime. Want to read about how tough it is to crack PGP?

With PGP you can create e-mail that only your recipient can read, encrypt

documents on your hard disk and more.  Start here :

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/'" tppabs="http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/">http://www.ifi.uio.no/pgp/</A><BR>

 If you use PGP, take care: PGP 2.6.3. is still probably the best choice, since

PGP versions over version 5, tough easier to use, have a special

'mitsniffer' function built within that

will allow third parts to read your encrypted emailings. (A sad world, isn't it?)

<BR><BR>

<B>Usenet postings</B><BR>

Usenet postings are <I>de facto</I> 'public' emailings. Anyone can peruse them, and dejavue (and

other

depots) allows you to quickly search through millions of them, as you'll be able to

learn <FONT color=red>[</FONT><A href="enemy.htm#older" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/enemy.htm#older">here</A><FONT color=red>]</FONT>.

to gather information about the poster:<HR><PRE>

You see the path line? That's almost the same as for a normal email, you can read there

all the servers that have brought this article until reference.com (where I have fished it).

Forte Free Agent? Forte

Agent 1.5/32.451?) In the last case a very honest lemming (uses windows and has paid for his

registrated full-version of Forte) we could target for windows advertisment... in the

hope we have not found a reverser that has cracked his version!<BR>

<B>Deleting Files</B><BR>

There are many utilities out there, whatever you decide to use,

 set it to do a dozen overwrites of random zeroes and ones. Be aware

of the fact that -if anyone can physically access yopur computer- it is

always possible to understand ('feel') if the bit that AT THE MOMENT

CARRIES A ONE HAD A ZERO OR A ONE BEFORE! A small charge residuate is

in fact persistent over the first (and may be even the second) delete...

overwrite a dozen times, as I said then, after you have erased your

sensitive files this way, repeat the process erasing all

free space on your "real" hard disk (as you may have <FONT color=red>[</FONT><A

href="twodisk.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/twodisk.htm">read</A><FONT color=red>]</FONT>, you should

always use TWO harddisks: the 'innocent traveler' one and your 'real' one).<BR>

Do your burning twice for good measure, then defragment the disk.

<BR>

Considering that the sensitive files were PGP encrypted to start with, I just

hope that nobody will ever be able to read those files.

<BR>

Another issue is the creation of the original file, the one you are going to

encrypt.  Would traces of it,

pre-encryption, be hanging around?  Possibly.  So never create them by

writing them to your hard disk.  Use a floppy.  Create and save files to

a floppy, encrypt it, <B><U>then</U></B> transfer it to the hard disk.  No trace of the

thing pre-encryption should ever exist on your hard drive.

<BR>

The floppy?  Burn it.  Literally. Turn it into ash.

<BR>

Floppies are cheap, and there are enough people giving away disks with

trial software out there to fill your needs.  You probably have

dozens of AOL disks

sitting around.  Many old games I had on floppies have gone to Magazine's CDs (and can

be bought for next to nothing in all good second-hand shops), and there are still folks out

there promoting their services on 3.5" disks...

<BR>

You decode a binary, base 64, file using your preferred decoder.

Little do you know that

a copy of the original file is stored somewhere, often inside the

Preferences folder in the System folder.  Burn 'em.  Browser Global

History?  Burn it.  Cache?  Set it to zero.  Anything shows up there,

burn it.

<BR>In Netscape, it is fairly easy to disable much of the functionality of

Cookies, by making the cookies.txt file "read only" (PC).

Else replace the File MagicCookies with an empty folder with the same name in

your Netscape Preferences folder (Mac).<BR>This will allow you to visit

sites that ban

cookies disabled visits, and yet you'll write no cookie!  And while your in there,

burn your Global History file.  And set your cache to zero, you get a

fresh copy of each site you visit and no record of where you've been is

written to your disk.

<BR>

And try to visit sites via a proxy site. The Anonymizer is good, but many

sites are refusing access to visits originating from there.  A little

research will turn up some <FONT color=red>[</FONT><A href="ideale7.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideale7.htm">proxy sites</A><FONT

color=red>]</FONT> you can go through :-)<BR>

<B>Digital_IDs invaders: VeriSign</B><BR><BR>(Thanks to Casey Lide for this info, you 

may want to visit <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.collegehill.com/ilp-news/index.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.collegehill.com/ilp-news/index.html'" tppabs="http://www.collegehill.com/ilp-news/index.html">The Internet Legal Practice Newsletter</A>)<BR>

<BR>

Despite some misleading statements by VeriSign, a web site can choose to have Digital IDs

automatically transferred, with no involvement or choice from the end user whatsoever. Digital

IDs can be customized and added to, and are, in effect, tools to facilitate the creation of

consumer marketing profiles. VeriSign is (perhaps primarily) a database marketing tool. Itís not

about consumers verifying that theyíre who they say they are so that they can make

point-and-click purchases online Itís the gathering and distribution of information about the

consumers themselves, and the existence of an elaborate framework of strategically aligned

companies poised to capitalize on it, while the producers of the information (the consumers)

remain ignorant of the whole practice.



Why are Digital IDs used? Here the words of the commercial bastards themselves, you'll

easily reverse their real meaning: "<FONT color=purple>Since the information fields in Digital

IDs

are customizable and extensible, you can also more easily track user activity to

acquire more precise demographic information about your customers, and more accurate

readings on the effectiveness of web site marketing or other online promotions...

Digital IDs provide a unique identifier for each user that you can use to . . .

personalize the information or advertising displayed to a user, match behavioral

patterns with a userís profile. . . . You can even link a visitorís Digital ID to

customer-specific information, such as purchase history, that resides in your

database</FONT>. These Digital Id's are something more than cookies:  accomplished by

Verisign through several companies, strategically aligned with VeriSign,

which exist solely to "offer the following products and services (to webmasters):

tracking and analysis of web site traffic; demographic and psychographic profiles

of web site visitors; servers for targeted advertising and web content; and comprehensive 1:1

marketing capabilities.<BR> So now you understand WHY there are so many 'free'

trackers, counters and messageboards around. Man I could puke :-)

<BR>

So how is this done? There are two aspects to the Digital ID infrastructure which are probably

unknown to the average end user who signs up. First, there are functionally no limits on what a

Digital ID can contain, and there is no guarantee that the end-user has absolute control over

whatís contained in his own Digital ID. They can be customized and extended upon (though, by whom

is not entirely clear). Second, there is an elaborate hierarchy of IAís (Issuing Authorities) and

LRAís (Local Registration Authorities) and CAís (Certificate Authorities) and PCAís (Public

Certificate Authorities): VeriSign, Inc. is at the root, while the end-user is the leaf at the

end of the branch. A hierarchical structure such as that, while perhaps necessary for the "web of

trust" model of authentication, also lends itself to the use of early artificial intelligence

technologies. The unrestricted practice of database marketing/datamining -- and consumer

profiling -- relies heavily on similar technology. This hierarchical structure should be closely

watched.<BR>

Personally, as EU-citizien, I would like to know <U>HOW</U> exactly the European Union is 

implementing its Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council 

of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the 

processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data... and its 

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://europa.eu.int/search97cgi/s97_cgi/?action=View&VdkVgwKey=/europa-8071/htdocs/eur-lex/en/lif/dat/en_397L0066.html&DocOffset=1&DocsFound=76&QueryZip=Directive+95/46/EC&Collection=fullEUROPA&SearchUrl=/search97cgi/s97_cgi?a%98%e4c  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://europa.eu.int/search97cgi/s97_cgi/?action=View&VdkVgwKey=/europa-8071/htdocs/eur-lex/en/lif/dat/en_397L0066.html&DocOffset=1&DocsFound=76&QueryZip=Directive+95/46/EC&Collection=fullEUROPA&SearchUrl=/search97cgi/s97_cgi?a%98%e4c'" tppabs="http://europa.eu.int/search97cgi/s97_cgi/?action=View&VdkVgwKey=/europa-8071/htdocs/eur-lex/en/lif/dat/en_397L0066.html&DocOffset=1&DocsFound=76&QueryZip=Directive+95/46/EC&Collection=fullEUROPA&SearchUrl=/search97cgi/s97_cgi?a%98%e4c">Directive</A>  

97/66/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 December 1997 concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. 

Probably, as usual with good European legislation, some of the 

more commercially corrupt Member States and/or more feudally managed regional areas 

of the Union (like Catalonia and Bayern) are grinding all 

wheels an playing all possible dirty delaying tricks in order to AVOID any 

implementation at all costs (because defending the privacy of their 

citiziens would be tantamount to an heavy attack towards many of their 

commercial friends (and supporters) and, moreover, to some strong American interests, 

since most of these snooping services are based in 

the States). These developments should be closely watched by all reversers IMO.

Let's go over to our cookies and to DoubleClick.

<BR><BR><HR>

<A name="double"></A>

<B>Cookies invaders: DoubleClick</B><BR><BR>

The king of the privacy invaders: DoubleClick seems to be up to some new

tricks these days.

<BR>

Double Click is the outfit that tracks your movements on the internet, and

makes sure you receive an ad banner, etc --- wherever you visit --- that

they have determined should be "of interest to you" --- based upon their data

base of your browsing habits.

<BR>

Ok, here's what you'll do right now: have a look at your folder windows/cookies. Do a grep search

for your

REAL email address. Chances are that you'll find it inside some cookie. Scared? That's

nothing, those are the OLDER ones, that did not even care to encrypt your data... Now

do a grep search for doubleclick... here is one of them:

<FONT color=blue><PRE>

id

61b8610f

doubleclick.net/

0

1868938761

13583431

0046757619

29692000

*

</PRE></FONT>

But there will be more occurrences, of course.<BR>



Well, ole Double Click now has the ability to target ads to you based upon

your telephone area code used in your internet telephone connection.

<BR>

Further, one of the shortcomings of "Cookies" as used by Double Click, is

that while the Cookie will identify your computer on a particular site ---

if you do not visit that site again for weeks or months --- the Cookie is

of little use to Double Click.

Therefore, beginning next year (1999), Double Click is reported to be installing

special snooping

software that will identify your computer wherever it goes --- weeks and

months after an original Cookies may have been placed on your computer by

Double Click for a particular site. The Cookies placed by Double Click will

apparently no longer be site specific -- but rather specific to your

computer --- and apparently, to your name --- so your movements on the WWW

can be monitored wherever you go --- whenever you go there.

<BR>

Once again, it is the ubiquitous Cookie that makes all of this possible.

As we said, in Netscape, it is fairly easy to disable much of the functionality of

Cookies, by making the cookies.txt file "read only", but there is a very simple

solution to permanently block cookies silently on

nearly any browser. You'll just need an hex-editor.

<HR><FONT color=blue>Watch it... all the following tricks are still experimental, depend on

many variables and may not apply for all type of browsers. Moreover the following

tricks could damage your software. Use at your own

risk and only if you know what you are doing. On the other hand... what's life

without reversing a little? :-)

</FONT><HR>



You load the

browser's executable into the editor, and search for the string

"set-cookie" (it might be in uppercase). Once you've found it, alter it by changing some

characters. Simply overwrite them. For example, you could change it

to "no-cookies". Then save (and use) the altered file.

<BR>Now instead of looking for "set-cookie" in the http headers your browser

will be looking for "no-cookies". When a site sends a cookie it will send

"set-cookie" in the httpd headers, but your browsers will no longer

recognize that as the code for a cookie. Instead the cookie header will

ignored. No requester, no cookie :-)

<BR>



Another trick you can use with the Trumpet winsock dialer: in the directory under

which Trumpet winsock was installed, there is a file named HOSTS.

Simply add the following two lines to the file :

<PRE>   127.0.0.1  doubleclick.net

   127.0.0.1  ad.doubleclick.net</PRE><BR>

This trick completely blocks any connection to doubleclick, so neither

 coocky exchange will take place <U>nor the ad will appear on the web page</U>.

<BR>

Another possible trick is to write a small batch file that you'll use to launch your browser,

say something like <PRE>

rem fravia's cookiesmasher

c:\

cd windows\cookies

del *.*</PRE><BR>

This is NOT as good as removing all cookies for good (since the various commercial

bastards will start pumping cookies back as soon as you visit them) but it has a

couple of advantages: <UL><LI>The whole significance of cookies is negated by the simple

fact that you'r always a 'newbie' in the cookies world (so they are NOT targeting

you effectively and their data are somehow falsed)</LI><LI>It is much simpler to implement

in a <A href="corporate.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/corporate.htm">corporate</A> environment, where more 'heavy' reversing

operations could give you problems.</LI></UL><BR>

from idiotical commercial ads, see the banner killer script at <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://greythorne.home.ml.org/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://greythorne.home.ml.org/'" tppabs="http://greythorne.home.ml.org/">greythorne's</A>. 

Java runs inside a Sandbox, yet ActiveX (Micro$oft's crap, as usual) can access 

ANYTHING that you have on your PC.<BR>

Active-x controls are PROGRAMS, that you load, install and start onto your own PC. 

 Such executable code, including unauthorized ActiveX code, can do just 

about anything it wants, from reading and writing files 

to installing software, such as games, or viruses. <BR>

It is relatively easy to use them in order to check the serial numbers of your software or 

to exchange data with a bank.<BR>In theory Micro$oft's "Authenticode technology" for verifying 

the origins of software components could try to block evil applets 

from accessing a user's PC, since the evil applet would not contain an 

identifying digital signature. Alas this 'technology' is very easy to 

reverse and, moreover, the whole Active-x certification bazaar does not make much sense, since European certifications 

are NOT allowed by Micro$oft, as a consequence the (very weak) certification protections 

are not even implemented on most browsers. The problem isn't just downloading evil code, it's 

also downloading bozo code, if a black reverser can get ahold of an 

ActiveX component installed on your box, 

he could give it arguments and it would toast your machine.

<BR>

Particularly evil crackers (of the 'black' stream) 'fish' everyday poor unsuspecting 

active-x-enabled lamers and throw all sort of crap inside their PC. A particular 

malevolent attack is that if their control find Quicken, it would NOT just issue a 

transfer order and add it to that application's batch of existing transfer orders (following the 

ccc-people famous example), but it would try 

to <U>change</U> all "0x33",  (that's the number 3, duh) into 

"Ox38" (that's the number "8", duh) inside all Excel and Word files (luser will have 

them if he is lemming around with Windoze). Remember when you tricked with your pencil a 

3 into an 8? Think what will happen as soon as the bank-employees of YOUR OWN bank (or 

railway, or hospital) will fall for that... :-(<BR>

A good reason to choose banks, railways and hospitals (and everything else) 

that DO NOT use Micro$oft browsers and 

products... I know it's getting <FONT color=red>[</FONT><A href="infowarf.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/infowarf.htm">more and more 

unlikely</A><FONT color=red>]</FONT>, but there's no 

reason I shouldn't add my own pebbles to the M$-demise nevertheless :-)<BR>

You should consider disabling the ActiveX capability in your browser 

or using a browser such as Opera, or Netscape Navigator, which does not support ActiveX. Setting to maximum the 'security' feature of your M$-browser 

is NOT an option, btw, since it is pretty easy to 

create a link to a <A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.thur.de/home/steffen/activex/index_e.html  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.thur.de/home/steffen/activex/index_e.html'" tppabs="http://www.thur.de/home/steffen/activex/index_e.html">small applet</A> that will MODIFY it if needs be.
