  Neutralizing MM256.DAT and MM2048.DAT files<BR>

  by ZenGuy+

<H3>

  The Problem

</H3>

<P>

The main problems with the MM256.DAT and MM2048.DAT files have been outlined

in detail <A href="mmstory.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/mmstory.htm">elsewhere </A> (fravia's

<I>What's behind the mm256.dat and mm2048.dat

files?</I>) . &nbsp;Suffice it to say that any

files such as these that:

<UL>

  <LI>

    allegedly collect the user's entire URL history (i.e. a record of everywhere

    you've ever surfed); and/or

  <LI>

    allegedly contain a summary of the entire directory structure of your hard

    drive

</UL>

<P>

can be considered to pose a potential security or privacy threat.

&nbsp;Ominously, these files <STRONG>cannot</STRONG> be deleted by users,

and multiple copies are stored in various locations on the user's hard drive.

<H3>

  An Interim Solution

</H3>

<P>

The simple procedures outlined below are intended as a first step in creating

a workaround to this problem, at least until someone finds a better solution.

&nbsp;It is also hoped that the suggestions below might lead to feedback

and suggestions for improvement from others. &nbsp;Why not offer your suggestions

to <A HREF="info.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/info.htm">Fravia</A>?

<P>

Here are the basic steps to neutralize these files:

<P>

<STRONG>Step 1: &nbsp;Locate the files on your hard drive</STRONG>

<P>

Copies of the MM256.DAT and MM2048.DAT files can be found in any or all of

the following locations. Check the table below and make a list of where the

files are located on your hard drive. Check the following locations:<BR>

<BR>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

  <CENTER>

    <TABLE WIDTH="93%" BORDER CELLPADDING="2">

      <TR>

	<TD>C:\WINDOWS\COOKIES</TD>

	<TD>&nbsp;</TD>

      </TR>

      <TR>

	<TD>C:\WINDOWS\HISTORY</TD>

	<TD>&nbsp;</TD>

      </TR>

      <TR>

	<TD>C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\</TD>

	<TD>&nbsp;</TD>

      </TR>

      <TR>

	<TD>C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files\CACHE1</TD>

	<TD>(Note: Actual directory name may be different for IE-4 users)</TD>

      </TR>

      <TR>

	<TD>C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files\CACHE2</TD>

	<TD>(Note: Actual directory name CACHE1 different for IE-4 users)</TD>

      </TR>

      <TR>

	<TD>C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files\CACHE3</TD>

	<TD>(Note: Actual directory name CACHE1 different for IE-4 users)</TD>

      </TR>

      <TR>

	<TD>C:\WINDOWS\Temporary Internet Files\CACHE4</TD>

	<TD>(Note: Actual directory name CACHE1 different for IE-4 users)</TD>

      </TR>

    </TABLE>

  </CENTER>

</DIV>

<P>

<STRONG>Step 2: &nbsp;Edit each MM256.DAT and MM2048.DAT file with Windows

Notepad, deleting all content found in each file.&nbsp;</STRONG>

<P>

This is fairly self-explanatory, but there is one trick needed to save the

file properly. &nbsp;Just open each file in Notepad, select all the existing

content, then press the Delete button. &nbsp;Now save the changes you've

made to the file, <EM>using double-quotes around the filename</EM>. &nbsp;This

will ensure the file is saved with the proper extension (i.e. '.dat').

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  Example:

  <P>

  <DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

    <CENTER>

      <IMG SRC="1.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/1.gif" WIDTH="426" HEIGHT="264">

    </CENTER>

  </DIV>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

By the way, once the file is saved, its file size should now be 'zero'.

<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="Step 3">Step 3: &nbsp;'Lock' each file by changing its

'attributes' to 'Read-only'.</A></STRONG>

<P>

This is easier than it sounds. &nbsp;Simply go to Windows Explorer, navigate

to the proper directory, right-click on the file, click on 'Properties',

then check the 'Read-only' checkbox and click 'OK'. (For extra protection,

click on the 'Hidden' checkbox too).

<P>

Example:

<P>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

  <CENTER>

    <IMG SRC="2.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/2.gif" WIDTH="366" HEIGHT="413">

  </CENTER>

</DIV>

<P>

<P>

<STRONG>Step 4: &nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations -- the MM256.DAT and MM2048.DAT

files have been neutralized. You are done!</STRONG>

<P>

  <HR NOSHADE WIDTH="93%">

<H3>

  Other Tricks:

</H3>

<P>

For those who want to go further than simply locking the MM256.DAT and MM2048.DAT

files, here are some other suggestions. &nbsp;

<P>

<STRONG>Deleting Existing Cookies</STRONG>

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  Please note: For this suggestion it is recommended that you also add the

  'hidden' attribute to C:\WINDOWS\Cookies\MM2048.DAT<BR>

  and<BR>

  C:\WINDOWS\Cookies\MM256.DAT<BR>

  as in '<A HREF="#Step 3">Step 3</A>' above.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

To automatically delete Internet Explorer 'cookies' when booting up, simply

edit your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT with Notepad, adding the following 2 lines to the

end of the file:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  echo Clearing C:\WINDOWS\COOKIES ...<BR>

  echo y| del C:\WINDOWS\COOKIES\*.*

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

then save the file. This will delete all stored cookie files, but leave the

2 locked '.dat' files intact.

<P>

<STRONG>Deleting Internet Explorer's Cache Files</STRONG>

<P>

IE's cached files can also be deleted upon booting up your PC, for extra

privacy, and to conserve hard drive space. Edit your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT with

Notepad, adding the following 6 lines to the end of the file:

<BLOCKQUOTE>

  echo Clearing all C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE files ...<BR>

  echo y| del C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE1\*.*<BR>

  echo y| del C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE2\*.*<BR>

  echo y| del C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE3\*.*<BR>

  echo y| del C:\WINDOWS\TEMPOR~1\CACHE4\*.*<BR>

  echo y| del C:\WINDOWS\HISTORY\*.*

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>

<STRONG>NOTE</STRONG>: It is recommended that you double-check the directory

name of the CACHE1, CACHE2, CACHE3, and CACHE4 directories. If you have ever

used IE version 4, these directories will likely have a slightly different

name. &nbsp;If so, just edit the lines shown above accordingly, and put these

instead in your C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT.

<P>

Now save the file.

<H3>

  Some Warnings

</H3>

<P>

As noted previously, the procedures outlined above are experimental.

&nbsp;Please note, therefore, the following known issues and limitations.

<P>

<STRONG>Internet Explorer Error Message</STRONG>

<P>

Once the '.DAT' files have been 'locked', starting up Internet Explorer (I

have only tested version 3) will produce the following seemingly serious

error message:<BR>

<BR>

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">

  <CENTER>

    <IMG SRC="3.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/3.gif" WIDTH="398" HEIGHT="138">

  </CENTER>

</DIV>

<P>

Oh my! &nbsp;Sit back and be very amused as IE screams bloody murder because

it can't get its paws on those nasty files &lt;heh heh heh&gt; &nbsp;(Kind

of reminds me of HAL in the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey' as he's being

shutdown&nbsp;:-). &nbsp;)

<P ALIGN=Left>

In fact, the 'serious error message' turns out to be mostly a non-issue:

&nbsp;IE appears to function quite normally after the user simply presses

'OK'. &nbsp;Note that it is certainly possible that no cookies can now be

saved, but this user considers that a good thing; besides, you should probably

be using Netscape or Opera anyway if you value your privacy at all, right?

Still, this does need to be tested. And speaking of testing...

<P>

<STRONG>Scope of&nbsp;Testing</STRONG>

<P>

The above procedures have so far been tested with the Windoze 95 operating

system. &nbsp;Your mileage may vary (YMMV) with Windoze 3.1 or Windoze NT.

&nbsp;Also I have not tested the procedures with Internet Explorer 4, only

IE 3. The Netscape browser works just fine, and I assume that Opera would

be alright too. Hey, why not do some quick testing on your operating system

and <A HREF="info.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/info.htm">send the results</A>? &nbsp;Make your own contribution to the battle for online privacy!

<P>

Thanks for your time -- I hope this essay proves helpful to some readers.
