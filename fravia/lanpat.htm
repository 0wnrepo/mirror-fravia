<CENTER><H3><I>(Fravia's semantical reverse engineering tricks)</I></H3>



 <BR>~<BR>

Enemy tracking, a very difficult art, can be divided into stalking, reversing language patterns  and luring. In order to 

stalk you need a deep knowledge of Usenet spamming (and war) techniques like flaming, 

trolling and crossposting. A good reverser can moreover easily 'reconstruct' (part of) the 

snailtrail of his 

enemies and defeat their smoke curtains  

applying some easy semantical reverse engineering tricks. Finally the reverser will 

lure his targets into the open web and identify it.<HR width="33%">

<CENTER><H2>Reversing language patterns</H2>

</CENTER>

<P>

 I have randomly taken from today post two snippets :-)<BR>Now tell me, 

this one:<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>

<PRE>man..could ya pleeeeez send me ( if ya got it ) the Casmate crack ??? 

need the shit bad..gonna d/l the software directly form the casmate site..</PRE></FONT>

And this one:<FONT COLOR=PURPLE>

<PRE>I subscribe to a very good service: LinkAlarm that periodically 

checks the links on my pages (now well over 200 links). Do you use it?</PRE></FONT>

have been written by the same person?<P>

The answer is NO, they have been written by two different persons, but how can I be 

so sure? The language patterns differ, yet this could of course be intentional. You 

will know why, I believe, as soon as you have read the content of this page.<BR>(<FONT color=red>*</FONT>I 

have published it at the bottom, in reverse order, you'll check later :-)

<P>

Well, reversing language patterns seems to be something pretty new: I could not find much 

on the web. So I'll try to summarize,  and slowly add in this page, 

what I have noticed experimentally until now. I'll also teach you <U>my own</U> best stalking  

method: <FONT color=blue>Fravia's stalking tablet</FONT> (TM :-)<BR>Please 

take note that in the following, as usual in our reversing tradition, with "target" I 

intend the person (and pseudo) 

you want to find more data about (and if possible his real identity)<HR>

There are many 'inconscious' characteristics in someone's writings and ramblings, and 

contraryly to what you may think, email comunication does indeed carry A LOT of clues that 

are <U>as useful as</U> theusual body language clues you costantly 

check when you comunicate physically with 

someone or all the clues given by your partner's voice when you are at the telephone.<BR>

Some of these clues are of linguistical, other of grammatical and others are of what I would 

call 'Internettical' type... with this I mean clues that neither voice nor paper 

printed comunication usually convoy.<P>



Since we must start from somewhere, as first clue I would use 

 the "gender" differences.<BR>For gender here I do not 

mean that you can state if your target is a woman or a man (if you could it would be 

probably a pretty poor target :-)<BR>I mean that you can state if your target uses 'male' or 

'female' patterns in his communication... 

chances are that if he uses these patterns under one bogus 

identity, he'll use them under all other ones as well... :-)<BR>Now, please, 

understand me correctly, 

because I do 

not want to be pulled into any useless 'gender style' discussion... and I know that many 

American friends are obsessed by this kind of crap (writing she/he and so on). 

So let's be clear: I 

have always been convinced that, apart from minor obvious physical differences, there 

is NO real difference between Women and Men, in all good or evil characteristics 

of our specie. Women can (and of course <U>should</U>, with <I>bona pace</I> of all species of 

religious idiotical fundamentalists) drive, kill, write, love, play 

and fight as well as any man, 

and anyway there are so many women with male psychological characteristics and so many 

men with female psychological characteristics that I believe it 

does not make much sense  

to differenciate anything between the twin parts of our race.<P>Yet among the few 

physical differences cited above is the well known fact 

that women give birth to children, and this, added to 

society pressures, common tradition, biased instruction, television crap, 

advertisement conditioning, 

you name it,  makes a LOT of almost inconscious differences and 

can actually give us the possibility of reversing (in part) 

the 'gender leaning' language patterns of our target.

<P>

 In other words analysing usenet style emailings you may check if  your target has a more 

"female" or a more "male" personality basing on the following:

<P>

The male style is characterized by adversariality: put-downs, strong often contentious

assertions, lengthy and/or frequent postings, self-promotion, and sarcasm (not always witty).

<P>The female-gendered

style, in contrast, has two aspects which typically are found together: 

supportiveness and attenuation.

<P>

Male-targets use more coarse and abusive language and seem to change their opinions slightly 

less often than females-targets.

<P>

Female-targets send more messages explicitly referring to other members of the group than Male-targets.

<P>

Context differences certainly may obscure or speciously highlight your 

results. Always 

work <I>cum grano salis</I>. In the usual 

context of Internet discussion groups "normal" group psychology does not apply. 

Group membership on usenet is very large and members

 do not know all others in the group (especially if there are a large number of

"lurkers", people who read messages but does not write responses and therefore are 

invisible inside the discussion).<BR>

Morever on Usenete the task is mostly not to produce a specific result, but

rather to generate ideas and discuss them. 

<P>

Male-gendered targets in discussion groups use language

that a) states facts without personal ownership, b) challenges group members, c) calls for

explicit action, d) is argumentative, e) uses coarse and abusive language, and f) attempt 

to indicates the

members status.<P>

Female-gendered targets 

in discussion groups  use a language that a) self-discloses, b) states

personal ownership of opinion, c) apologizes, d) asks questions, e) uses "we" pronouns, f)

responds directly to others in the group, and g) seeks to prevent or alleviate tension or

arguments.

<P>

Exactly as we have a male/female differenciation, there are MANY other 'sharp 

edges' that you can use to stalk your target, as you will see in my tablet below.

<P>

Keep in mind that

computer conversation draws from features of both written and oral discourse and as such 

has a whole serie of linguistic and textual patterns: <U>Emphatic</U>, <U>Humorous</U>, <U>Informal</U>.

<P>



Syntactic informality often takes the form of incomplete sentences and conversational cadences.

For isntance<PRE>"Waitamoment!... what d'you mean?"; "Hmm, I see. . .";  "Mmm, no, no... I didn't mind it..."</PRE>

<P>

The informal, conversational rhythm created by the "Hmm", "Mmm" and the ellipsis is clearly intended to

evoke (although through written means) 

<U>spoken</U> discourse. Similarly, , "Wouw", "Sigh", "Gulp" 

and "Gasp" are used

occasionally to mimic vocalizations or paralinguistic features. 

<P>

Another device used to mimic characteristics of speech is the textual indication of emphasis on

words or phrases (present in many messages). For example, some targets 

OFTEN use capital

letters to create the sense of oral emphasis, 

others *use asterisks*, others S P A C E S and some use the html tags, 

inside their emails, &lt;u&gt; for this same purpose &lt;/u&gt;.



<P>

 Such emphasis cannot be indicated in the written text using underlining

or italics, obecause most protocols for exchanging electronic mail, don't support them 

yet (expect an explosion of clues as soon as colors will be commonly email exchanged :-)



<P>

All these clues depend from 

the alphanumeric characters of written text, that are used to

evoke the emphasis of speech.

<P> In some

cases, exclamation points  add oral emphasis, as in the subject line "No No! Flush it!!"<BR>



<P>Yet there are also involontary clues: <BR>

A good stalker always takes note of how many exclamation points and how many question 

marks the target 'commonly' uses. There are many different patterns:

<BR>?<BR> &nbsp; ?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (space 

and question mark)<BR>??<BR>???<BR>? ? ?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and so on<BR>This is 

of course true also for commas<FONT color=red>,</FONT> colons<FONT color=red>,</FONT>semicolons <FONT color=red>,</FONT> and <FONT color=red>(</FONT>parenthesis <FONT color=red>)</FONT> that may or may not 

be spaced before the preceding word.<BR>

Another typical involontary clue is due to the 'typing habits' of your target. He may, 

for instance, often enough write 'inetresting' instead of 'interesting'; 'nuff' instead 

of 'enough', and so on and so on. This is of course pretty rare, yet it happens in less 

evident parts of the message. For instance, does your target break line<BR>when he wants 

to substantiate a point? Does he write short or long sentences? Does he use tirets - like this - 

or rather parenthesis (like this)? And what about his emotycons? :-] is NOT :o)<P>

Finally, does he write "i use" or "I use"? Often enough email is sent WITHOUT any 

automated spelling correction check whatsoever. 





<P>

There are also 'comportamental" e-mail clues, for instance there are some 

email comments, 

on a thread, that at times clearly resemble those that occur 

in a face-to-face meeting, when a speaker turns

towards and briefly addresses one of the individuals present, 

but without yielding the floor to

that person: "What's your opinion about this, Brick?" "Hope to hear from Cal about 

this stuff!<P>

This kind of attitude pattern  can constitute a very STRONG clue when you try to 

identify a target.

<P>

 Another example is when you suspect, examining the thread, 

the existence of private, backchannels between your target and somebody else. <BR>

Backchannels, on usenet, are nothing else than the electronic communication 

between two or more

individuals <U>that is not sent to the group as a whole</U>.<BR>This can 

at times be evinced from the contexts. Such messages, like whispered side

conversations in a meeting, involve concerns or strategies 

adopted by allies on particular

issues.<BR>

In this cases you may try to find out 

which are the 'allies' and the 'reference points' of your target 

inside the group and attack from those sides.<BR> You'll VERY FREQUENTLY find 

this when you stalk trolls (see <A href="enemy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/enemy.htm">enemy.htm</A>), because 

trolls are trollyng mostly IN ORDER to find and contact other trolls-savy.

<P>Yet another 'comportamental' example is the interplay among MORE THAN ONE 

fictious identities. In Balif's example (see <A href="enemy.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/enemy.htm">enemy.htm</A>), you 

have seen how his target used a whole plethora of faked personalities in order 

to create a 'group' impression. Of course the more fictious identities you identify, 

the easier it is to see the common sharp edges they possess.

<P>

Thus the language of Usenet demonstrates several characteristics more typical of

oral communication in an organizational setting, casual conversation or, rather, 

organized meetings.

<P>

In fact the 

syntax and word choice often evoke conversational informality, emphasis, rhythm, and even

vocalizations. On the other hand, the messages may also 

evince characteristics of written discourse such

as formal wording, careful composing and editing, and textual formatting.<BR>A typical case 

is when there is a LIST of points<UL><LI>1) inside</LI><LI>2) your target's</LI>

<LI>3) email</LI></UL>There is also at times an interesting 

evidence of patterns that are a distinctively characteristic of web 

interaction. Many messages display ascii graphic, 

typographical ascii jokes, signets and subject line humor, patterns also that are very 

unlikely in written and oral discourse. All such patterns ca  be, 

at times, interesting clues.

<P>

These clues and patterns reflect both the capabilities of the web and the characteristics

of the group. The interactivity of oral discourse is in fact supported and encouraged on Usenet by

the ability to engage in rapid exchanges and to collect and 

respond to embedded excerpts of previous

messages. At the same time the asynchronous nature of the web and the editing capabilities of

the participants' email applications allow 

reflection and crafting patterns more characteristic of the

written discourse. The web's ability to support informal 

textual exchanges allow a playful relationship with the text, or 

to indulge in flaming.

<P>Of course all sort of interaction, 

the characteristics of the individual targets, their social

community, and their motherlanguage influence the particular combination of linguistic and

textual characteristics that they express.<P>Do not underestimate

 the richness and complexity of email communication... as soon as 

you'll have learned your stalking abc you'll never miss much all 

the clues that the real, non virtual world gives you when you communicate.

<P>I don't think it needs a lot of explanations, keep in mind that the PURPOSE of the above tablet 

is not so much to understand directly WHO is your target, but to understand if your target is in 

reality the one candidate you suspect. Once you have zeroed in, you'll stalk the 

(presumibly less protected) 

other PSEUDO in order to find out -if all works well- WHO is your target... 

and some  luring techniques (and social engineering) 

will at that moment be quite useful, see my <A href="luring.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/luring.htm">luring.htm</A> section...

<HR><H2>

A word of warning:</H2><BR>

You found my site and you are reading this, therefore you have now a

relatively  "high" level of web-lore and reversing knowledge.<BR>

Until recently I kept this section of mine in 

a "closed" server  

with other mildly powerful and potentially dangerous tutorials and tools. I am now 

going public with my stalking lore because spamming has taken incredibly 

annoying proportions and I have decided to create as many powerful reversers as possible 

in order to tackle and destroy the 

commercial idiots.<P>Yet, as you perfectly know, 

 knowledge can be used either for good or for evil. Knowledge, especially 

this kind of knowledge, is a powerful weapon. You may use it to defend yourself but 

you may <U>not</U> use it to offend innocents<BR>I hope 

to have you at my side, fighting on the web for knowledge and against all 

commercial zombies, but I cannot avoid that 

you join the dark side if you want to... if you do, however, take care not to meet me.
