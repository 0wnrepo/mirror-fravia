Taming Monsters, finding clowns</FONT>

<BR><FONT size="+1">by fravia+ (MSRE)</FONT>

</CENTER><PRE>

	Well, I don't know if you have ever been puzzled by two little strings 

inside Netscape.exe, the main executable of Navigator. I'm using <FONT color="blue">netscape.exe, 

version 3.0, 2.980.864 bytes</FONT>, a very stabile version.



	Anyway, I wanted to check if string 6698 and 6699... 

<FONT color="purple">

6698, &quot;This pre-release copy of Netscape Navigator has expired\n

and can only be used to download a newer version of Navigator.&quot;



6699, &quot;This copy of Netscape has expired.\n

This pre-release copy of Netscape Navigator has expired\n

and can only be used to download a newer version of Navigator.&quot;</FONT>



 ...really corresponded to some weird eventual protection scheme or

 not. So I went on a session that dig out no protection scheme at all, 

 but eventually produced a monster text file and fished out a lot of clowns.

 I'll make it short about the protection scheme: 

 It seems to me that the trial strings above are obsolete, (yet anything 

 can happen inside a huge 4 millions bytes executable, and I may have 

 missed some no more connected vestige of a protection scheme :-) 

 	I reckon that they were foreseen for an &quot;eventual&quot; 90-days trial 

 limitation that was never implemented, as the hard struggle against 

 the &quot;Net crusade&quot; that Micro$oft started compelled Netscape to give its 

 navigator away for free.

 	So they gave it, nominally  to &quot;students&quot; &quot;libraries&quot; and &quot;charitable 

 non-profit organisations&quot;... de facto to every individual that cared, 

 <U>without</U> any limitation whatsoever, as you can read in the disclaimer 

 part, which carries the following rather amusing &quot;scarecrow&quot; message:

 <FONT color="purple">   

	You may not modify, translate, reverse engineer, 

	decompile or disassemble this software (except to 

	the extent applicable laws specifically prohibit 

	such restriction)

 </FONT>

 	Note the text in parentheses, which in the reality negates completely 

 the preceding scarecrowing sentence... you may want to have a look at 

 my <A href="legal.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/legal.htm">Is software reverse engineering illegal?&quot;</A> essay in order to 

 understand the reasons behind these &quot;scarecrow&quot; messages.

 	Software for free to any individual! A right and obvious choice in our

 eyes, since we all believe that software should be free... yet, clearly, it must 

 have been a suffered decision for Netscape, mad in the hope to keep enough hold 

 of the browser market to allow to compensate all lost revenues, from individual

 clients, through all &quot;institution&quot; and &quot;industry&quot; licenses. 

 I don't know if this worked (I doubt it), but they don't seem to have 

 had much of a choice, seen the might of Micro$oft's MSIE attack. 

 	Anyway I have examined the code (albeit only superficially) of 

 netscape.exe and there does not seem to be any real protection inside 

 Netscape now. 

 

 	Yet the point of this note is another... if you would like to 

 examine yourself the code you'll see what I mean... you are in 

 for a threat!

 	First of all you must produce your dead listing. The strings 

 above have been gathered through Borland Resource Workshop, which 

 works flawlessly and pretty quickly, yet to work on a target you 

 have to disassemble it. When you disassemble netscape.exe (I used 

 wdasm) you get a &quot;dead listing&quot; which is bigger than the hard disk 

 we used to have a couple of years ago: over 44 millions bytes of 

 text! 

 A real monster file! Try to load <U>that</U> inside Microsoft Word... 

 wont even accept it! 

 But even using better texteditors (which by the way are as usual 

 much cheaper, smaller and powerful than Micro$oft's abominations) 

 it will take you (and I'm using a Siemens Nixdorf P166 with 32 RAM) 

 two minutes just to load it, two and a half minutes just to search 

 it and four to five minutes to <U>unload</U> that monstrosity, 

 with  your hearth bleeding seeing all hard disk and memory leds 

 grinding their teeth and spitting their lights! You better give it 

 up... its' not worth it anyway, and go back to BRWing netscape. Have 

 a look at the strings. Should you want to find those strings inside netscape 

exe, remember that you would have to search for HEX bytes with interpolated

00s, and not for, say &quot;expired&quot;, because, as usual, part of the strings have 

been &quot;doublebyted&quot; for compiler reasons... even if these string snippets look 

(to you) the same inside BRW:<FONT color="purple">

&quot;This pre-release copy of Netscape Navigator has expired\n...&quot;</FONT>

and<FONT color="purple">

&quot;...modify, translate, reverse engineer...&quot;</FONT>

They are NOT the same.

The first snipped, BRW string 6698, is at byte 29D71A and looks like this:<FONT color="purple">

610069006E002E007600540068006900  a.i.n...v.T.h.i.

730020007000720065002D0072006500  s. .p.r.e.-.r.e.

6C006500610073006500200063006F00  l.e.a.s.e. .c.o.</FONT>

(By the way, the second &quot;expired&quot; string, BRW string 6699, starts at 

byte 29D808)



The second snippet is at byte 2824C7 and looks like this:<FONT color="purple">

3B0D0A20202A206D6F646966792C2074  .......modify, t

72616E736C6174652C20726576657273  ranslate, revers

6520656E67696E6565722C206465636F  e engineer, deco</FONT>



I know that all &quot;old hands&quot; know this, but I remember how annoying it 

was for me, as a newbye, being unable to find soome strings inside my 

targets.

So, as you can see, in order to find such strings you'll have to load 

the target inside your hexeditor and then search for bytes <U>with 

interpolated zeros</U>.

	This has to do, as chown pointed out, with &quot;Unicode&quot; strings. Unicode 

is a 16-bit character standard to help developers intrenationalize their 

programs (8-bit hcracter sets have a mathematical limit of 256 characters, 

which is far too few for langiages like Japanese, Korean or Chinese, which 

have several thousand characters. Unicode, encompassing 65536 possible 

characters, takes care of that.

	Many tools, useful for us crackers, already support this standard:

- New versions of Hexworkshop can search for Unicode strings.

- Peek, a very useful extraction tool (<A href="tppmsgs/msgs2.htm#267" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tppmsgs/msgs2.htm#267">peek11.zip</A> will

  extratct all strings (included unicode) from any file.

- The Unix ported string program from our beloved NTInternals also has 

  an Unicode command line option.



 	Back to BRW resource editing... as +ORC always reminded us, it's 

 jolly worth to look at the &quot;hidden guts&quot; of an application, because 

 programmers leave behind, among many other wasted spaces, a lot of 

 information that can eventually be useful... Well, I did not find 

 anything useful at all, yet here are some interesting snippet from 

 the &quot;guts&quot; of Netscape: <FONT color="purple">

	Then, should you be interested, which I doubt, follow also all 

	the names of the people  working inside the  &quot;Production&quot; and 

	&quot;Management&quot; of Mozilla/Netscape. 

	Finally you'll get to this nice excerpt from the &quot;Book of Mozilla&quot;:

	<FONT color="purple">

 The Book of Mozilla, 12:10

&quot;And the beast shall come forth surrounded by a roiling cloud of vengeance.

 The house of the unbelievers shall be razed and they shall be scorched to the earth.

 Their tags shall blink until the end of days&quot;

                                    from <B>The Book of Mozilla,</B> 12:10

  </FONT>

	C'mon, tell me the truth... you did not know that you were browsing 

the Net with this message inside your application, did you?

	Yes, <FONT color="blue">&quot;Easter eggs&quot;</FONT>, as they call them, little snippets &quot;hidden&quot; 

inside the applications you use. Obviously you can get to the above 

clown names and Book of Mozilla &quot;pages&quot; through a link combination 

that I will let the interested reader find out. 

The same easteregging practices are (sadly) in use inside almost all 

windows95 applications. One of the most awful duties of a reverse 

engineer is to fish out such stupidity from these overbloated targets.

Here we go... sorry about this squalor, but I believe that everybody 

should know about this, at least in order to ridicule the Authors 

of such crap... a GOOD programmer will be recognised through his code, 

and these guys feel the need to stuff their photographs in the 

overbloated applications that we (don't :-) buy!

	In Excel '97 there is, for instance a sort of &quot;doom&quot; game hidden 

inside the spreadsheet, you can walk on a &quot;ridge&quot; until you arrive to 

a wall with the names (and photographs!) of all the clowns that worked 

on this &quot;123 killer&quot; Micro$oft product. Let's do it the other way round: 

I'll tell you how you get it and you'll have a look at the code (if 

interested in such crap): choose Create New doc/go to line 95/ select 

whole line 95 clicking left on the number 95 / tab / you are now in 95B / 

choose about MS-Excel / CTRL+SHIFT and click techincal support and now 

you'll see the &quot;doom&quot; window.

	In Word and in Windows 95 itself you'll find once more the same 

marmalades...(you probably already knew it, didn't you?).

Actually the clowns at Micro$oft seem to be the most fanatic (and the 

most prone to byte waste) eastereggers around... they probably believe 

firmly that, since they design anyway much too overbloated programs, 

a couple of million bytes more in order to show us the visages of 

such able programmers (it's ironic :-) would not damage nobody. Actually 

if I'm not mistaken they started this trend back in DOS with MSD.exe, 

a M$-diagnostic utility for dos 6.2... try the sequence help/about/F1 

there and try to fetch it back in the code... that's a good reverse 

engineering exercise. But easter eggs are now proliferating... you'll 

find them in <FONT color="bliue">Corel draw</FONT>; in <FONT color="blue">windows NT</FONT> (scren saver easter eggs in 

&quot;3D texts&quot;)... in windows NTv3.51 workstation tape &quot;beer&quot; and get a list 

of M$' clowns preferite beers (they don't understand nothing about beers 

btw)... inside <FONT color="blue">Word 97</FONT> there is a whole silly 

<U>flipper</U>! (maybe the only reason to buy such a crappish product :-)

OK, i'll give you this one too... create new doc / tape &quot;Blue&quot; / double 

click on &quot;blue&quot; / bold it / choose color blue / unselect it / add a space 

after &quot;blue&quot; / select &quot;about&quot; /click icone... you'll be able to find 

easily most of the Easter eggs reversing the &quot;about&quot; routine... use the 

techniques I have explained in my &quot;filemon&quot; essay, for instance... if you 

do you are in for some (pretty sad) surprises: Quicken, Freehand, Cakewalk,

Flight Simulator 6 (here you must give the coordinates of Redmont to your 

plane) and so on and so on.



Such is the sad tragedy of software life under the talon of Micro$oft 

domination... even programmers who should hate anything 

vaguely microsoftish, like Netscape's ones, did &quot;notscape&quot; it.
