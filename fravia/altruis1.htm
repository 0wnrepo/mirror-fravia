                 <P><I>Well, there's a long story behind this... Depp dt has a nice 

'reality cracking' site on the web (I don't publish it because he did not ask for it, yet all 

good net seekers will be able to find it) and I did not publish some of his 

previous essays because I had the impression that they were too much 'passionate' and 

(maybe I'm wrong) IMO a real "reality cracking" essay should be always "cool" and should 

avoid the tragical (and comical) 

destiny of weird nerds everywhere: taking themselves too seriously. So I didn't publish 

some previous essays, but I am publishing this one... and I hope somebody else will 

BUILD on this in order to get a more correct (or should I say a more 'reversed'?) 

evaluation of our conditioning patterns.</I></CENTER>

                 * - altruism, giving without any personal benefit.

                 <P>

                 In Britain, and quite possibly worldwide(?), students are actually

                 taught

                 at colleges and universities that altruism does not exist. It happened

                 to

                 me when I did my degree some time ago and it happened to a friend taking

                 his degree last year. I think that it's taught to new students before

                 they

                 are practiced at analysing an argument and before they are encouraged to

                 have their own opinions and to argue with their lecturers. It is

                 presented

                 as accepted, objective fact without a real opportunity to disagree. 

                 <P>

                 The argument goes like this. Social Psychology's 'reward theory' states

                 that for every act of giving, there is an equivalent 'value' received in

                 return so there can never be altruism because the giver always receives

                 something of equal value. Just search the net on altruism and I'm sure

                 that

                 you'll see the argument. The trouble with the argument which seems lost

                 on

                 the academics is that it's a totally 'tautological' or circular

                 argument -

                 you are within the argument - it can't be disproved because of the way

                 it's

                 stated. Now, if the argument was stated that altruism does exist, that

                 there is never such a thing as an equal exchange - that could not ever

                 be

                 disproved either.

                 <P>

                 Let's take an example. I'm on a crowded bus and I give up my seat to

                 allow

                 a pregnant woman to sit. Now according to 'reward theory', I didn't do

                 this

                 because I am willing to help strangers when I'm able to and when it's

                 fairly easy to do so. No, I received from this 'exchange', good feelings

                 for myself equal to the value of the effort expended. What nonsense, but

                 the trouble is I'm within the argument which ASSUMES that a trade occurs

                 and defines the reward in terms of that trade.

                 <P>

                 To disprove this theory, people are forced to find an example where

                 there

                 is obviously no reward for the 'altruism'. The normal example is the

                 anonymous kidney donor. Oh no, say the reward theorists, he receives a

                 kidney's-worth of good feelings. And any other example you think about,

                 freeware, helping a blind person across the road, anything at all. The

                 point is that <B>the theory is based on the assumption that it's innate

                 for

                 people to trade</B>. It supports the dominant Capitalist ideology and

                 states that you don't and can't do anything for nothing and that

                 everything

                 has it's price. 

                 <P>

                 Is there any hope for humanity if we teach and are taught that we cannot

                 relate to each other than on this basis?. The implications are quite

                 horrendous - that the concept of charity does not exist, that economic

                 aid

                 requires an economic return (which is often the case in practice) but I

                 think the main point is that we are being taught to be fantastically

                 selfish - worse than that - we are being taught that there is no other

                 way

                 except to be fantastically selfish, individualistic and self-centered.

                 <P>

                 By accepting this teaching we are transformed into individual consuming

                 units. Individual consuming units are important because they mean

                 greater

                 demand for consumer products. However, they also mean loneliness,

                 solitude

                 and alienation from others. Can you really love someone on this basis? I

                 think that it was Caesar who originally developed the theory of divide

                 and

                 conquer ...<BR>
