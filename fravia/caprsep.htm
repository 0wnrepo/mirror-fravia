<PRE>		Dear fravia+,



                  Thank you for your honest response. I must admit, I only posed the 

                 questions to prod you into a self examination of why you publish, 

                 maybe even deeper than you questioned it before. I did this because 

                 after visiting your sight for a year+1/2, I feel you already have 

                 the answers to your questions, maybe they are just a little hard to 

                 see.



                 "Why I publish"

                 "  I decided to publish my "page of reverse engineering" because the 

                 inner working of computer programs (and any other thing) has

                   always fascinated me."



                 As long as you are true to your beliefs,

                 ANY DIRECTION WHICH YOU DECIDE TO TAKE IS THE RIGHT ONE. 



                 Many directions will satisfy the quote above. Even though 

                 'protection scheme's' seem to be the highlite, I believe we are all 

                 here because we share the same fascination. The 'high' for us is not 

                 really to reverse code,for it is only 1 vehicle, but to reverse the 

                 programmer's(writers's,politician's,business's)  thought process. 

                 That's all we do. Programs are not generated by machines. There are 

                 so many path's to travel to this end that it becomes difficult to 

                 focus on an area. As far as the luzers go, they will always flock to 

                 steal knowledge and parade it under their banner. This has always 

                 been, and will always be. But there facade soon collapse's and they 

                 are exposed as  'creaters void of form' . You are so correct in your 

                 statement that the 'majority of humanity doe's not want to cast off 

                  there chains'. It gives them a finite realm to exist in,and they 

                 would not survive without it. You can not worry about them. But, 

                 there are a some who will seek, and it is them your pages are for.



                 In conclusion,



                         Where do YOU want to go today ?
