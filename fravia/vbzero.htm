Cracking a Visual Basic program with a decompiler

Cracking Plasmid Toolkit 1.3

</FONT>

Plasmid Toolkit version 1.3 (1996) from Microbe Software can be found at

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://129.105.116.5/fravia/ptk-demo.exe  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://129.105.116.5/fravia/ptk-demo.exe'" tppabs="http://129.105.116.5/fravia/ptk-demo.exe">ftp.sunet.se/pub/molbio/ibmpc/ptk-demo.exe</A>.

The main exe file is PTK13.EXE (1 040 448 bytes).



 This program is pretty useless, even for a DNA hacker like me, but I

decided to crack it, because the authors of this program were too pushy

asking for my money and I don't like that. As it turned out, this program is

also good candidate for the most stupid protection award (IMHO).

 To make it clear: I can understand if a programmer implements a simple

protection scheme knowing that it will protect against average users, (even 

if the more complicated ones will be useless against dedicated crackers :-)

 What I can't understand is, why they put two locks on the front door and

let the back door wide open. As you will see, in this case it probably took the

programmer more time to code and debug the protection routine than us to

crack it. 



Let's see the target:

 During installation, we observe that the program installs vbrun300.dll,

so we have another Visual Basic &quot;toy application&quot;, on our hands. After 

starting it, the first thing we get is a registration form (nice welcome!) 

with Name, Company and Licence info required. Pressing the Cancel button

takes us through a nag screen (which reminds us about the unregistered

status of the program) to the working area. We load up a sample map and

quickly discover that the export and save functions have been disabled and 

that in the middle of our plasmid graphic sits a &quot;unregistered version&quot; sign.

Upon leaving the program we get another nag screen, reminding us to register

in order &quot;to enable all functions&quot;.

 Well, we have here an arsenal of nag functions (and a licence agreement

that even Micro$oft could envy), all these problems can be cured entering 

a correct licence number.



Let's crack:

 This program, written in Visual Basic, means that WDASM is no good, and 

that debugging with Softice will not be a great fun, either. 

You could crack the registration as written in the fine essay by Razzia, 

of course... yet let's see if there is another... a more &quot;relaxed&quot; way. 

Let's try first of all DoDi's excellent VBdecompiler, an obvious choice. 

You can get the demo version from his homepage at 

<A href="tppmsgs/msgs2.htm#241" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/tppmsgs/msgs2.htm#241">http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/DoDi/</A> but it 

can't decompile large files like ptk13.exe, so I suggest to get the registered

version of this nice decompiler, somehow :-)



 Let the decompiler operate on the PTK13.EXE file. Surprise! It works nicely

and we practically have the VB source code in our hands (what a shame!).

The meaningful variable names are gone, but that's really no problem 

for us.

After a little searching, we find the interesting REGFORM.BAS module.

Ok, let's peek into it! All right, the code deals with the registration,

and the most interesting part is this:



Sub OKButton_Click () 

Dim l005A As Integer <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Flag</FONT>

Dim l005C As String

Dim l0060 As Integer

l005A% = fn6338(rname, rlicence) <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Flag set here</FONT>

If  (l005A% = 1) Then  

  gv0668 = Trim$(rlicence.Text) <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Good guy goes here</FONT>

  gv0664 = Trim$(rname.Text)

  gv066C = Trim$(rcomp.Text)

  l005C$ = gv0464 &amp; &quot;ptk.ini&quot;

  l0060% = extfn1050(&quot;Registration&quot;, &quot;Registered User&quot;, gv0664, l005C$)

  l0060% = extfn1050(&quot;Registration&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, gv066C, l005C$)

  l0060% = extfn1050(&quot;Registration&quot;, &quot;Licence Number&quot;, gv0668, l005C$)

  PFWmenu.Export.Enabled = True <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Let's enable everything for good guy</FONT>

  PFWmenu.save.Enabled = True

  PFWmenu.save_as.Enabled = True

  PFWmenu.SaveButton.Enabled = True

  Unload RegForm

Else 

  gv0668 = &quot;&quot; <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Bad guy goes here</FONT>

  rlicence.Text = &quot;&quot;

  MsgBox &quot;Invalid Licence Number&quot;, 48, &quot;Registration Failure&quot;

  Exit Sub

End If

End Sub



Function fn6338 (p0068, p006C As Variant) As Integer <FONT color="purple">&lt;-This sets the flag</FONT>

Dim l0072 As String

If  (Len(Trim$(p006C)) &lt;&gt; 16 Or Mid$(Trim$(p006C), 6, 1) &lt;&gt; &quot;-&quot;) Then

  fn6338 = 0 	

  Exit Function			

End If

l0072$ = fn2030(p0068) <FONT color="purple">&lt;- Last ten char of the licence is calculated</FONT>

If  (UCase$(Mid$(Trim$(p006C), 7, 10)) = l0072$) Then	

  fn6338 = 1			

Else

  fn6338 = 0

End If

End Function



 Well, the above snippet talks for itself. The licence code is checked

with the fn6338 function which gets the name and registration code as 

input. The code must be 16 char long with the 6th char being a dash.

 The last ten character of the code are created by the fn2030 function

which gets the name string as input. Ok, let's search for the fn2030

function in the decompiled modules. We find it in MODULE5.BAS:



Function fn2030 (p000A As Variant) As String

Dim l000E As String

Dim l0010 As String

Dim l0012 As Integer

Dim l0014 As String

Dim l0016 As Integer

Dim l0018 As String

Dim l001A As Integer

Dim l001C As Integer

Dim l001E As Integer

l000E$ = Trim$(p000A)

l000E$ = LCase$(l000E$)

l0010$ = &quot;&quot;

For l0012% = 1 To Len(l000E$) <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Removing spaces</FONT>

  l0014$ = Mid$(l000E$, l0012%, 1)

  If  (l0014$ &lt;&gt; &quot; &quot;) Then

    l0010$ = l0010$ + l0014$

  End If

Next l0012%

l0016% = Len(l0010$)

l0018$ = &quot;&quot;

If  (l0016% &lt;= 10) Then <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Adjusting the lenght to 10 char</FONT>

  l0010$ = &quot;bibblefnord&quot; + l0010$

  l0010$ = Right$(l0010$, 10)

End If

For l0012% = 10 To 1 Step -1 <FONT color="purple">&lt;-Calculation of code</FONT>

  l0014$ = Mid$(l0010$, l0012%, 1)

  For l001A% = l0012% - 1 To 2 Step -1

    l001C% = Asc(l0014$) Xor Asc(Mid$(l0010$, l001A%, 1))

  Next l001A%

  If  (l001C% &gt; 90 Or l001C% <48) Then l001E%="l001C%" Mod 42 l001E%="l001E%" + 48 If (l001E% &gt; 57 And l001E% < 65) Then l001E%="l001E%" 7 End If l0014$="Chr$(l001E%)" End If l0018$="l0018$" + l0014$ Next l0012% fn2030="l0018$" End Function Finally, here it is, the heart of the code "generator..class" tppabs="http://fravia.org/generator..class" We can see the adjustment of the name string with "<Font color="purple">bibblefnord</font>&quot;, some XORing, etc., but

in fact we do not need to understand the precise mechanism of the code

generation to get a good code. We can rip out this function and modify it

a bit, to get the name input (p000A) from the keyboard and print the result

to the screen (actually, the &quot;12345-&quot;+result string, keeping in mind what

the fn6338 function does) and we get a perfect code generator in basic!

(Before you run the code you might have to tailor it a bit to your basic

interpreter, like with MS QBasic trim$ must be replaced by consecutive

Ltrim$ and Rtrim$ functions, etc).

 I did not write here any valid licence code, because the purpose of this

essay is not to distribute a crack for this useless program, but to show:



1) The beginner crackers that they can spare a lot of work by trying a VB

decompiler, before attacking with Softice.



2) The shareware VB programmers that it is useless to implement &quot;tricky&quot;

code generators, if they don't protect against decompilation. Not even

mentioning that they show their &quot;source code&quot; to the whole world. 

(&quot;Antidecompiler&quot; tools can be found on Dodi's homepage).



Finally, I would like to thank +ORC and his' students for the fine essays

and Fravia+ for his amazing WEB site.
