Hi Fravia 
<br><br>
I have long been enjoying your pages and found it
highly educational, 
even enligtening.
<br><br>
In the back of my mind the following idea has taken
shape wich could change the 
way some percieve reality. Dont take this as a
personall attack, some could just 
think it is true.
<br><br>
Let us say my name is Bill Gates and I have a nett
worth of billions and I am 
the CEO of the largest company in the world. What is
there left to achieve?
<br><br>
Well let us not go into all the mumblings of the
masses of 
monopolies and all the known ideas of being world
ruler etc.
<br><br>
Let us say I am bored stiff in this corporate setup
surrounded by people who 
cant program and has no idea of life. To add
excitement to life, I give myself 
the name +ORC and gather around me some net buddies,
near fanatics, whom I 
incite to form a closely knit band of people calling
themselves crackers. With 
my High Priests neatly following my way of thinking, I
retreat into obscurity to 
neatly monitor the progress of my handiwork, coming
out of hiding just to keep 
them on track. One of my followers, an extremeley
bright fellow, Fravia+ 
surpasses all my expectations and forms the first free
university on the net, 
spreading the truth like a virus. In the process all
flaws and cracks of my 
billion dollar company are exposed people are
contributing hours of their time 
to scrutinize all the programs my company has written,
as well as that of my 
oposition.
<br><br>
In effect my manipulating mind has created my own
personal quality controll 
section and research section, working for free.
<br><br>
Its like having a double agent, a real wolf in sheeps
clothing.
<br><br>
Back to reality as we thought we knew it.
<br><br>
Fravia+ these pages are truly inspirational, but if we
realy open our eyes WIDE 
+ 1, what do we see. Let me tell you what you could
see. 
<br><br>
As an example, take anonamyzer.com. In your writings
on anonimity you encourage 
people to use it. But let us asume devious old Bill is
behind it, WHY? -  well 
why not. Another wolf in sheeps clothing. If you want
to know who all these 
crackers are which are hurting your site, but you
can't find out because they 
are annonymous, what do you do. You spend a few thou
on a server, call it 
annonymous.com , let one of your trusted high priests
preach it as gospel, and 
all the converted come to you. It is the same as if
the police wishes to catch 
thieves and put the following advertisment in the
paper GET YOUR FINGERPRINTS 
REMOVED PERMANENTLY, NO MORE BEING LINKED TO ANY THEFT
SITE. And a very trusted 
thief in the thieving comunity convinces all his
buddies how great it worked for 
him. And in the process the police get a nice database
of potential thieves. In 
the process of removing the fingerprints, they smudge
it in such a way that the 
special smudge detector can identify each smudge to a
name in the database, and 
voila you are identified much easier than before.
<br><br>
What is the end result of your site, should you stop?
<br><br>
Let us examine your philosophy, you want to teach-,
educate the masses, a very 
noble thought, To sound a bit like +ORC (see I
actually like the guy), the zen 
way of looking at it. The idea of ying yang is
aplicable here, the good and the 
bad the one being contained within each other, in
other words as you increase 
the knowledge of the masses, you also increase the
knowledge of the money 
hungering, little people munching, corporate world out
there, the exact people 
you are out to fight. So in the end the game stays the
same its just the playing 
field that becomes smaller. 
<br><br>
It is an ongoing battle in wich you cannot stop,
because if you will, someone else 
will do it (maybe not as good), So keep up the good
work.

(I do not know Fravia+, +ORC or other famous cracker 
personally, this short 
piece is not intended to damage anybodys reputation,
merely to rattle your cage 
into percieving things differently, In other words, If
this is the truth or not, 
would the end result not stay the same?) 

<br><br>
<hr><i><center>Fravia's postponed comments</center><br><br>
Let's start (<u>first point</u>) stating that this kind of theories are typical 
semplifications-exaggerations: When people try to squeeze facts into a paranoical 
world-vision they either begin to nuke (or napalm) foreigners or they 
start to believe that Gates (or Pamela Anderson, or Hussein, or whoever happens to be 
under the lights) is the main
font of all evils. Paranoia is like a sweetbar, the more you suck the more you suck.<br>I don't find at all 
credible the idea that Bill Gates could (personally) care in the least about what 
we are doing, nor that he 
would have had, back in 1995, any sound knowledge whatsoever 
about reverse engineering matters (maybe now he as acquired such knowledges, 
in the mean time, personally or through lakeys...).<br>As a matter of fact I have, searching 
the web, the impression that nowadays even monkeys, donkeys and university 
professors are quickly and enthusiastically moving over to our reversing world... eheh.<br>Granted, people like Gates 
could have <u>paid 
someone</u>, back in 1995, to spread something like +ORC tut, but that would have 
been on the short, medium and long term pretty contra-productive 
from his/her point of view and, moreover, it would 
have spoiled, IMO, the very purpose you are &quot;discerning&quot; behind his supposed moves...<br>See: either reversing software 
gives <u>more</u> power to the users, or it gives <u>more</u> information, feedback, whatever 
to the slavemasters. If the latter were true, I believe you would see it much more implemented and 
much less (legally) hindered.<br><br>
<u>Second point</u>: you over-estimate (a lot) both +ORC's, the +HCU and my own contributions: 
the reversing scene is (and was from the beginning) MUCH more deep and complicated than  
you seem to think: there are (and have been) 
THOUSANDS of very good reversers (thanks God!) everywhere!<br>+ORC did not &quot;create crackers&quot; at all... 
they have been there since the beginning (I myself have been cracking protections on my 
wackely Sinclair 
Spectrum already in the 80's...)<br>In fact you'll nowadays 
find outstanding reversers (if you look 
hard enough) everywhere: as members of the crackers' groups, 
inside the (huge and clever) graphic &quot;demo&quot; scene, among the virii 
wizards, between the &quot;keygen&quot; cracking obsessed and even (though not so 
frequently IMO) inside the &quot;plaudering&quot; IRC scene :-)<br>And, besides, 
there are also hackers, cryptographers, 
clever protectors, html wizards, old unix masters... you name them... even trainers wizards and 
people cracking on-line games have learned all tricks of the trade... <u>without us</u>!<br>See: be humble! 
Even when you believe you have discovered a new planet, for others it's just hot water...<br>
We are just part of a much broader movement (luckily, since history 
teaches us that we have some chances only when we are PART of the many waves, neither &quot;the 
only one&quot; nor &quot;the first&quot; wave... only primadonnas and ego-feeble kids may be 
bothered by 
the fact that they are just part of a throw of arrows, neither the first nor the 
quicker one), 
<br>Yes, we are part of a momentum-gathering movement that - 
from many paths and directions - is slowly converging towards a simple truth: the 
necessity to acknowledge, in a more and more 'abstract' software world,  
the fundamental
importance of assembly (and reversing) for our &quot;everyday life&quot; reversing purposes (and anyone 
reading the reality cracking essays on my site knows how important this is).<br>It is a pendulous movement... 
a reaction: a bit of yang after the ying push (I'm following vanrigter's language :-) 
the more 
&quot;they&quot; (whoever &quot;they&quot; are, btw... it would be about time that we better define our 
targets...) would like you to be a Guinea Pig or to slurp advertisements and smile while drooling, 
<u>the more</u> you actually -all of a sudden- do NOT happen to want to be a 
Guinea Pig, to slurp advertisement or to drool.<br>
Notice also how they HAVE TO pay even slaves, nowadays, in order to compel them to 
waych ads...<br><br>See: you don't need an +ORC to catalize that. Any sparkle would 
(and will :-) suffice.<br><br>
<u>Third point</u>: the plan you accuse Gates of: let's have feedback for free on 
my bugs, is exactly what M$oft (and not only) is doing RIGHT NOW with the beta versions 
that do not work, with the bugs that have to be corrected by the end user and so on. 
Have a look at a standard Micro$oft disclaimer and you'll woner how anyone in his right mind 
could come to the idea of buying (i.e. spending real money for) such poorly implemented
 software...
<br><br>
I did advice Anonymizer? Yes, indeed, (a long) time ago I did in effect encourage 
people to use it (and other half-anonymizing tools as well, btw): I insist: 
better than 
nothing. See: there are scripts for those using PGP (&quot;ah-ahhh! This mec uses PGP, from now on he 
should be scrutinized&quot;), there are scripts for those using the words &quot;crack&quot;, 
&quot;kalashnikow&quot;, &quot;detonator&quot; and so on anywhere on the web... never believe you'r NOT being checked.
From this point pf view I must agree with vanrighter... you'll NEVER be paranoid enough.
<br>Don't think, anyway, that you have any good and real chance to keep and defend your 
anonymity 
on the web (unless you go to great lengths to protect yourself, which is 
extremely <u>boring</u>).<br> Moreover keep in mind that  
anonymity counter measures evolve with a speed we cannot even hope to follow: 
and nowadays 
I would give a different advice than the anonymizer... for instance <u>have a look</u> at the very recent (if I'm not mistaken they have 
been put up yesterday) Iefaf's proxy and tools pages: these links ARE really 
useful: http://altern.org/cortomalt/tools.htm and 
http://altern.org/cortomalt/anonlink.htm 
<br>
So: this said paranoia is mostly dangerous, only seldom useful, my dear vanrigter...
