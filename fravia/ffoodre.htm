Know the shit you eat, or FAST FOODs!!

<BR></H3></CENTER><HR>

Okay, you already know it: Fast Food is shit for you.

Then why millions of people still use to eat there?

Many reasons, my

friends.<BR>

First of all, fast foods are, as the name says, fast:

people with a

short lunch break, who work far away from home go to a

fast food to

have their poor lunch before going back to their poor,

stressing job.<BR>

Hey, ever wondered why F\Fs are fast? How comes that

nobody stays there

for a long time? Think about any fast food you have in

your town: it

could be McDonalds, Burger King, Burghy or any other:

what are the main

(only ;-) colours you find there inside? Easy one:

yellows, red . . .<BR>

Why? Because they are hot, exciting colours: you'll

never find a "blue

& green" F\F. This makes it almost impossible to relax,

i.e. to take

your time.<BR>

Then, you have to seat, and that's point two. In fact

the seats in F\Fs

are *always* uncomfortable. In this way, you will soon

feel a desire to

go away, and *that's what they want*.

Hey, what are you telling to me? they want you to *go

away*? Sure

thing, my friend, as usually you will only buy once,

when you get

inside the F\F.  All the time you spend at the table is

a taken seat

with no profit.<BR>

So, you buy only once... and here we come to the

"menus": they offer

you for a "cheap" price, say cheese burger, chips and

large coke, and

you gonna buy 'em. But what if all you wanted was a

plain burger, no

chips and a small coke? Well, ok, it's cheap, i'm

hungry, 'cheese

burger deluxe' menu'll be okay. F\F are also very

cheap. . . that's for

two main reasons: first is that they don't need to pay

many employees:

you have to throw your garbage away by yourself,

automatic kitchens

cook the food and one cashier can serve many people.

Second is that

food is junk: the meat they use is slaughter's refuse;

they'll tell you

"Hey, have this nice burger: it's 100% beef!! Aren't we

great ? ? ?"<BR>

Bullshit. It is true it is pure beef, but my question

is: "which parts

of the beef are used?", chips are out of potatoes

frozen in the

subcontinents and refryed in palm oil before use. And

this takes me to

the food.<BR>

Ever tryed to have a cheeseburger in Malta's

McDonald's, one in Rome's,

one in Gatwick airport's in London and one in

S.Francisco's? They just

taste all the same: they have studied cooking times,

studied, exclusive

ketchup recepies, studied way to put stuff in the

burger. They want it

to be soft: people don't like to chew, they want it

juicy: it feels

like mouth filling, they want it sweet (it's true:

taste one, and

you'll see ;-), 'cause people like sweet taste more

than all the

others. They taste all the same, also because in this

way, the

foreigner will feel familiar with McDon, BurgKing or

anything it is,

where ever he is.<BR><BR>

 By the way, note that burger's meat is only about 19%

fat. That's not

because they care for your health, but because when you

cook a burger,

fat melts and drains, and if fat is a consistent part

of the whole

burger, the burger itself reduces its size and it

doesn't look like a

big juicy burger, bigger than the bread.

About coke (or pepsi, same crap), books could be

written. Just a few

things about it.

Coke is a 'plastic' drink: it is basically water,

sugar, caffeine,

artificial flavours (in some countries, you could find

'natural

flavours' just 'cause they *imitate* (sic!) naturale

flavours, the way

artificial vanilline imitates real, natural vanilla).

BTW, it was

invented as a remedy for headaches.

Coke will  just leave thirstier than you were, *ready

to consume

again*. That's because you'll find hortophosphoric acid

in it. This

acid will dry up your mouth almost immediatly.

Coke is not actually dangerous for its acidity, though.

It is true (i

tried it) that it dissolves coins (well, actually only

the very

external layer), but it will not harm a human stomach,

as in our

stomach is a lot of very more powerful acid, used to

digest food you

eat.

<BR><BR>

So, are you one of the (wo)men who work faraway and

"have to go" to

MacDonalds? Why don't you try to take with yourself a

sandwich and/or

some fruit ? Or you could do as a friend of mine,

kayaker, does: a

thermos full of vegetable soup milk and chocolate and a

piece of bread

to soak in the soup or some cookies to dive in the milk

& chocolate (or

milk and coffee).
