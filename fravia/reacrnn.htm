<PRE>

I just now, after about 2 years of visiting this site, managed to

read articles from your "Reality Cracking" section, and I admit, I 

think I read most of them.  So... here is my own candidate for publication.

(I wrote this with edit.com, so there'll probably be some funky CRs)



                        The exact science of guessing.

                             Futility of argument.



        It is comforting to know that some things in life are certain;

Milk does a body good, Diamonds are forever, and the universe is rapidly

and continually expanding.  I pause a moment to let the reader convince

himself of these thoughts.  To truely crack reality, one must put aside

what is "known" -- I used the quotes to signify that we know for certain

absolutely nothing.  Confuscious said "To know that we know what we

know, that is true knowledge"; I disagree.  

"To understand that we cannot know what we think we know" is a more 

enlightened statement.

        We "know" that time passes at a constant rate.  Siddhartha may

have summed up this argument with a single phrase: "time is not real"; the

concept of time is distorted, it's new meaning has evolved from circular

reasoning.  Time is generally considered to be an interval that

perpetuates life into the future.  Life is measured in time.  Time was 

created by the thought that events happen in an order, not all at one.  

The sun rose, I ate Lunch, the sun set.  The idea of order required an 

event to seperate the other events of daily life.  From the rather 

simplistic example above, the notion of infinite events was born.  

I woke, the position of the sun changed a little, it changed a little 

more...ad infinitum.  In this sense, life was measured in events. Each 

time a set of events repeated, man marked off another portion of his 

life gone.  Where is the guarantee that the sun moved across the sky 

at a constant rate?  The only indication would be that man felt <U>roughly</U> 

the same ammount of fatigue at the end of each cycle.  From this

view it would be indiscernable whether the rate of the sun's travel

influenced the fatigue of the man, or whether the man had accomplished

roughly the same number of events, of course whether or not he started

each cycle with the same ammount of energy was in question, as well as the

nature of energy itself.

        It is possible to take any event or "truth" and find where an

unjustified assumption was made, merely because is fit the current

paragigm.

Let us not forget that fire was once believed to be the release of a

substance called "phlogiston" from the "burning" material, solely

because there was a visible trail(smoke) and the weight of the object was

decreased by burning; this held until a material was found that became heavier

once burned.  Now we believe that fire is the bonding of oxygen to another

substance, even though fire is hot, and heat is generally considered to

be from the breaking of molecular bonds.  Also some materials become

lighter once burned, thus the combination of oxygen must cause a molecule to

become less dense, while other burned substances become more dense.  This is

explained by the theory that "bonds" (also a theory) are of different

lengths because the "electrons that are bonding" (also a theory) are located at

different heights from the nucleis (another theory).  



Even experimentation is invalid based on Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle 

which basically states that through examination of any subject, we modify 

it's behavior.  A familliar example: Softice.  We use Softice to follow program 

flow, by setting a break-point, we actually alter flow to another program, 

never being 100% certain that the program we were previously running had not 

altered the breakpoint handler to point to itself, giving us a bogus set 

of data.



Here we believe that we necessarily are in softice, just because we've never 

seen a program do such things before.

        We may assume whatever conventions make our tasks easier, but

when we find our selves stumped by an apparent impossibility, we must not

hesitate to toss what we "know" out the window.  An important principle in

discovering the Theory of Relativity is the constancy of the propagation of 

light in vacuuo.  Light moves at a constant speed no matter what the velocity of

it's emitter.  I made a reference earlier to the "fact" that the universe is

constantly expanding.  This was determined by the frequency of the light

emitted by far away stars.  Doppler shift is a principle easily

detectable by the ear, a train whistle approaching has a higher frequency 

than one travelling away from you, the electromagnetic wave is shifted by 

the motion of the emitter toward one end of the spectrum.  



The frequency of light from far away stars is also shifted toward one end 

of the spectrum -- thus, they are rapidly traveling away... correct?  

Not according to the law of propagation of light in vacuuo; which, by the 

way was upheld by the man who did much work with the aforementioned atomic 

theory, Albert Einstein.  It should be noted that the propagation of light 

as such necessitates the Theory of Relativity, which makes such bold claims 

as to say that a man on a train travelling at 40 mph, if walking in the 

direction of the train's travel at 5 mph, has an overall speed NOT equal 

to 45 mph.  



This is due to the slowing of time for accelerated bodies...So much for 

time as a constant.  Thus is it valid to revert our measure of life to 

a number of events before death?  And then is immortality the lack of events?  

I think not. Humans ultimately are arrogant creatures, claiming to control

even that which they cannot possibly understand.  We can afford to take

nothing at it's face value.  Reality crack where you believe necessary,

compromise at only what MUST be cracked, lest your quota of events expire before

you can jot down your findings.



Forgive me for having been longwinded,

Seek Enlightenment, therein lie some truths.
