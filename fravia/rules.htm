ameliorate or update your essay once published,

</CENTER>

Please DO NOT SEND ME ANY &quot;obvious&quot; cracks, I feel

 always uneasy in refusing to publish someone's work, but I will not publish

useless cracks <A href="septem.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/septem.htm">any more</A>. This is a site

for software reverse engineering, and cracking

protection schemes is only a tiny part of it, albeit important

to lure young bozos crackers on the correct (i.e. white or red)

knowledge paths :-)

<BR>Once more:

 noone could care less about the kind of software you crack, what's

important is the reversing method in

itself, not the target you have chosen. Therefore,

unless your

 work refers to one of the BASIC tools we <A href="howtouse.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howtouse.htm">have to

use</A> (softice, wdasm, IDA, other debuggers, resource editors, 

 memory sniffers and so on, those essays are always welcomed), or unless

your work refers to an <A href="project7.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/project7.htm">extremely stupid protection</A>

,

please send

 only cracks referring to WEIRD protection schemes or to protection

 schemes that have NOT yet been explained enough. And we would still

prefer essays about general software reversing and crippled

functions enabling. You dig it?

<HR size="3">



<BR>                                              

Feel free to work on any one of the +HCU <A href="aca400.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/aca400.htm">projects</A>... 

all relevant results

will

be collected and published</CENTER>

<BR>- Please don't send obvious cracks!<BR>

- Please remember that noone cares about WHAT you crack (with rare 

exceptions), software comes and goes and there are zillion of warez sites 

on the web to get it regged for free... the

only important and really ever lasting thing of your work 

is the &quot;reverse engineering&quot; part<BR>



<BR>- If you use a lot

of code, please explain the protection scheme first, clearly and deeply,

hyperlinking the commented

code<BR>

- Please don't forget, for your target, to state exactly its VERSION, its

EXACT NAME AND WHERE TO

FIND IT... (you are not +ORC... and we are not amused to have to seek the

archies for very rare

targets  :-)<BR>

- It would always be better if you give an email address where people

can reach you with feedback and questions (I'm not going to push messages

around), yet if you <U>really</U> feel that you must, 

you may also send anonymously, in that case please don't forget to indicate

 which handle

you would like<BR>

- Please CHECK yourself

 that your essay does not blow Opera's or 

Navigator's marges out (just look at it in Opera, if it looks good in Opera 

it will work with any other decent browser of this planet)<BR>

- Please spellcheck your

text YOURSELF! (No vulgarities either, please, nor SuCh SilLy TExt, 

do use normal capitalization.  Separate your paragraphs with blank

lines.  Make your message inviting to your potential readers)<BR>- Please <FONT

color="blue">eliminate</FONT> from

wdasm code all useless parts (&quot;a jump&quot; instead of &quot;a

(c)onditional or

(u)nconditional jump&quot;, &quot;1&quot; instead of &quot;00000001&quot;,

and so on, just do yourself the search and replaces, please)<BR>

- Please: LESS CODE! MORE EXPLANATIONS! A good essay does not need much

code, (a very good essay does not need ANY code) 

and if you really need much code then EXPLAIN EVERY LINE! (and automagically 

you'll

immediatly realize that you did not needed that much :-)<BR><BR>

<PRE><B>Question</B>:<BR>

                &quot;Hey! What the heck should I reverse engineer then?&quot;<BR>

<B>Answer</B>:

                    * Demomakers' creations (graphic in assembly)

                    * Dongles (see <A href="project3.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/project3.htm">Project3</A>)

                    * CD-ROM bound (see <A href="project4.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/project4.htm">Project4</A>)

                    * Save disabled (See <A href="project6.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/project6.htm">project6</A>)

                    * Quivers (See for instance <A href="howto41.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/howto41.htm">+ORC's 4.1</A> or <A href="vizion1.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/vizion1.htm">Vizion's</A> essay)

                    * Orwellian targets (See <A href="project9.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/project9.htm">Project9</A>)

                    * DOS/Protected/Unix reversing are WELCOME!

                    * Perl scripts and site-busting <A href="ideale.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideale.htm">techniques</A>



		    * And you may try your hand at <A href="realicra.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/realicra.htm">reality cracking</A> as well...

</PRE><HR>

<I>Feel free to send good commented essays, 

I'll publish them (if necessary slightly modified) if worthy, well documented

and

not vulgar... once more, please, don't forget to download this <IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red"

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE &quot;INTUITION&quot; PROCESS YOU HAVE

FOLLOWED REVERSING YOUR TARGET<BR></FONT></CENTER><BR>

The actual crack is NOT very important... we all know how to crack protection

schemes, once we find them.<BR><BR>So the real problem is mostly <U>to land</U> in the correct part

of an overbloated code monstrosity, to <U>understand</U> some new

anti-reversing tricks, to <U>follow</U> a lead inside the dark codewoods.

By all means the purpose of our activity is NOT to give to the lusers a

ready-made crack receipt... there are hundred of wannabye crackers that do

just that all the time... if you are here because you need the crack for a

given program you are at the wrong address... here you will only be able to

learn how to do it yourself,

and this requires some 

grey matter inside your skull, serenity and

cogitation.<BR><BR>As master +ORC wrote once 

upon a time: <FONT color="blue">you are going to learn

a difficult art, not how to use ad nauseam simple

techniques</FONT><BR><BR>So: New protections, unusual protections, funny

undocumented functions, &quot;hidden&quot; or &quot;concealed&quot;

activities of your targets... this is interesting: HOW DID YOU SUSPECT IT?

HOW DID YOU FIND IT? And only then, eventually, you can also add how you did

crack it...but this 

is the most banal and less interesting part of your

essay, believe me.

<BR><BR>

The less code you use in your essay and the more explanation

you give about the TRY AND ERROR methods you have followed the better for

those

that are reading you and that mostly DO NOT CARE AT ALL for the target you

are

cracking in itself, as strange as this may appear to you... as a matter of

fact

they want to crack (or to protect) completely different programs!
