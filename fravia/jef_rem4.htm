<hr><b>Jeff</b> (June&nbsp; 1999)

<p>Dear fravia

<p>I find that I must change nearly everything on this page... that I had

'originally' sent to you:

<br>A funny thing happened on the way home from snuffing the banner; most

of them started breathing again...

<br>I tested each of these changes in Homesite and ran them thru this editor

and they seemed to work just fine. So I shipped them email and proudly

had a glass of water ( ) (Theres beer commercial on the boob-tube...says;

&quot;Its the water&quot; that makes it good.

<p>Hopeing that these changes would not only work... but also would work

undetected by a snoopy bot I soon came to the conclusion that the only

proper way to run these tests to find&nbsp; out if a bot did so; and the

only way I would feel comfortable while leaving others wide open to be

shut down, was to open an account at each of the mentioned sites instead

of testing other peoples web pages in my editor...Haveing done so I soon

discovered that most of the script changes that worked in editor did not

work in the real 'environment'.

<br>I have no clue why this is so; but the moral of the story is do not

trust your edtior while playing with javascript...(or don't trust yourself

if you don't have a clue to what your doing...:)

<br>I also found several of these ideas elsewhere ...and were not the accidents...

that most of my work is: I will try to go back to several places I have

visited and credit those authors here as I can.

<p>I set up an accountant with all of the sites I will mention below and

began experimenting:

<br>I believe I am now on experiment number 749 altogether...

<br>I have set the tests up to goto the actual test site/s so that they

can be monitored for any changes...

<br>Should they continue to work, for a number of months, I will move the

text and source here and close those sites...unless this format is perfered

?

<br>I have noticed that there is a problem when trying to run these ideas

below thru frames pages also...

<p><font color="#FF0000">NEW!</font>

<br><font color="#FF0000">UPDATE: </font>Sep-14-99

<br>I guess I am about done with banners for awhile; I have found sources

which know much more than I, and provide much more info than I can keep

up with; it has been fun; and I have learned alot...See the References

<br>Here are two variations that I have worked out to kill fortunecity

banners

<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/pascoe/414/fcitytest1/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/pascoe/414/fcitytest1/'" tppabs="http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/pascoe/414/fcitytest1/">Test

<br>results of test 1:

<br>Test 1 <font color="#CC0000">stops</font> working every <font color="#CC0000">fourth</font>

day. A Bot comes in an inserts code that pops a banner. Fortunately it

inserts the same code as in Test 2 below; which has remained working thru-out

the test period so far...

<p><a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/pascoe/414/fcitytest2/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/pascoe/414/fcitytest2/'" tppabs="http://skyscraper.fortunecity.com/pascoe/414/fcitytest2/">Test

2</a>

<p>Aha! On july 8; Test 2 <font color="#CC0000">stopped</font> working!

It gave me a 404 error page not found...does not exist;

<br>(I have left test 1 alone; u can see the error by clicking on it above)

<p>Going to the ftp site I was&nbsp; thinking I would discover it gone;

<br>I instead found that it was there and would let me view any directory

i had there <font color="#CC0000">EXCEPT</font> the directory for Test1

and Test2...the dirctories simply would not open! I don't know why but

I noticed that the file attributes were not the same as the other files

in the directory...

<br>so I <b>changed</b> Test2 which had at that moment&nbsp; ( drw-rw-r-)

<br><b>too</b> (drwxr-xr-r) (755) ...

<br>and hey! I was <b>then able</b> to open the directory and see my former

files...I then went back to fravias site and tried test 2 (above) and it

works now...

<p>So what happened? A bot found source tampering <b>and changed the file

attribute (?)</b> so that the page could not load? I assume it was a bot

because a human would simply have taken the site down...

<p>June 23, 1999

<br>All three Geocities Tests <font color="#CC0000">stopped working </font>at

same time on june 22;

<br>a bot came in an inserted a NEW code Above the Html tag;

<br>IT would seem that this bot assigned the account a NEW account number!

<br>and now all three have pop-ups once again...

<br>First lesson I learned here: Never set up&nbsp; multiple tests... within

a singel account...

<p>I will re-start this test to make sure i did not corrupt it somehow;

I'll also put each test in seperate account for proper moderating...arrrrrgh

...(for next update; not this one)

<p>july 4th

<br>well I discoverd several days ago that these <font color="#006600">original

Geocities tests are working again</font> <b>without my haveing made any

changes</b>;

<br>The new account number that was present on june 23, is now back to

the original account number...??? ...I had thought at first that perhaps

it was some time/date driven revolving script that changed the account

#s&nbsp; to stay on top of source tampering...can only continue to watch

this...time will tell...

<br>it seems the globe has done a change up on us..

<br>because the globe has (at least on my page above) <font color="#CC0000">stopped

<br>so using the xoom top banner code this top banner is now gone in test

<br>I&nbsp; myself&nbsp; do not care one way or the other if providers

use some small(er) unobtrusive&nbsp; embedded banner; somewhere at the

<br>Here is another idea I was playing with this morning; What I fear is

that my lack of knowledge is probably missing something...In this following

example for killing a &quot;permanent embedded ad&quot; (NOT a pop up ad) from virtualave

banner you will see all I did was to add in a &lt;!-- and a closing //--&gt;

so it will not print whats between the statement.........what I fear; is

my lack of knowledge does not allow me at this time to know weather or

not the bot that looks to see if the ad is still there will recognize my

addition and close down someones site for tampering......because I have

not changed the initial code I would hope not:

<p>here is vrtualaves banner code:

<br>By adding in these two lines, in the example below, I was able to kill

the banner in Homesite Editor:

What do u think? Does the virtualave bot still see the code as untampered

like this?

<br>(june 23, 1999; so far it sure has)

<p>I have a fravia+ mirror set up on virtualave that I have been embarressed

of because I corrupted your site by it haveing the virtualave banner on

it; I can proudly say now that I used the above code and my mirror site

no longer has this banner! (hummmm; it takes the banner away using MS (sorry;

test only) but then pops a Pop Up ad instead...another reason not to use

MS; eh?:) the mirror is at : <a href="javascript:if(confirm('http://the-ancient-one.virtualave.net/  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://the-ancient-one.virtualave.net/'" tppabs="http://the-ancient-one.virtualave.net/" target="_blank">http://the-ancient-one.virtualave.net/</a>

<p>Here is a nice informative letter <font color="#CC33CC">from the author

of the Proxomitron </font>tool, <font color="#CC33CC">Scott Lemmon</font>,

in response to some questions I asked:

<p>Hi,

<p>At 05:44 PM 6/25/99 -0700, you wrote:

<br>&gt;Dear Scott;

<br>&gt;Your tool is a gawdsend...

<br>&gt;

<br>&gt;As your tool is freeware I hope u will not mind me promoting its use

<br>&gt;here:

<br>&gt;http://129.105.116.5/fravia/jef_rem4.htm

<br>&gt;

<p>Glad you like it!&nbsp; Of course feel free to post it wherever you

wish.

<p>&gt;Because I am a seeker of knowledge I want to look deeper than mearly

<br>&gt;loading a tool and using it. I am wondering if you would mind

<br>&gt; in helping to explain what

<br>&gt;transpires when you click on a URL &amp;&nbsp; log into a ADspamming

site; how a

<p>&gt;proxy redirects as a buffer; and how filters work to cloak its

<br>&gt;messages...

<p>I'd be happy to help answer any questions if I can.

<p>&gt;Is it possible to include filters directly into source code; or can

<br>they

<br>&gt;only be read and acted upon by and thru the proxy buffer?

<p>Normally it's not possible to do this on the page itself. It works a

bit

<p>like this...

<p>Web page-&gt;web server-&gt;Proxomitron-&gt;Browser

<p>Ads and other junk are added by the free hosting sites at the web server

<p>stage of the journey. Because the Proxomitron comes after that, whatever

<p>HTML was added by the web server can be easily removed. The only trick

<br>is

<br>in sorting out what's been added from the page's original contents.

<br>Normally that's easy for any specific case (since the code is very

<br>predictable). The real challenge is making a single filter that works

in

<br>as

<br>many different situations as possible.

<p>When in comes to JavaScript however, sometimes it is possible to disable

<p>things on the web page itself. This is because with Netscape and IE4

or

<br>greater it's possible to replace a JavaScript command with one of your

<br>own.

<br>&nbsp;You can replace &quot;window.open&quot; for example, with a command that

does

<br>nothing. This, in fact, is the trick used by Proxomitron's default

<br>filter

<br>set to stop pop-up windows, and if you study very closely Proxomitron's

<br>home page you may notice something there too. ;-)

<p>The main problem is that it doesn't work on IE3 or Opera. Their

<br>JavaScript

<br>implementations aren't quite as advanced and don't allow overriding

of

<br>built-in functions.

<p>As I'm sure you've noticed, the most common way to block stuff from

the

<br>web

<br>page itself is by trying to place comments or other HTML before where

<br>the

<br>code will be inserted. I'm sure you've also noticed it's hard to make

it

<p>work all the time. Here's a few alternate way to &quot;comment out&quot; HTML

you

<br>may

<br>find useful.

<p>&lt;!--&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --&gt; Normal HTML comment

<br>&lt;noembed&gt; &lt;/noembed&gt; Works with any browser that supports the

&quot;embed&quot;

<br>command

<br>&lt;script language=&quot;foo&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; Browser's will ignore any language

the

<p>don't understand.

<p>There are other ways too. It won't help if the server inserts stuff

at

<br>the

<br>very top of the page (before the HTML tag even), but since that can

<br>confuse

<br>some browsers most will avoid doing so.

<br>&nbsp;

<p>Another interesting thing I've noticed is *many* sites (including

<br>Tripod,

<br>Geocities, and Xoom) will not insert stuff at all if they don't

<br>recognize

<br>the browser's user-agent HTTP header.&nbsp; This is to avoid causing

problems

<p>with browsers that may not support JavaScript. Unfortunately, although

<br>easy

<br>enough to do with a program like Proxomitron, this again is something

<br>that

<br>can't be changed on the webpage itself (since in this case the info

is

<br>coming from your browser).

<p>Hope that's of some help,

<p>Scott

<br>june 11;

<br>hummmmm; it seems the more web servers that I check the more slightly

different ways to eliminate their banners....perhaps I had better put together

a comphrehensive list and code changes for each as a regular essay rather

than haveing u take your time to cut and paste all these mails I keep sending???

Had I known when I began this yesterday that it would grow like this I

would have done so; I apologize... I hesitate once again however because

although the banners are indeed gone I fear that bot will see my changes

and bring someones page down...I do not want this to happen to anyone for

sure....Would u prefer me to do it or is this way okay?

<p>

<hr>

<br>

<hr WIDTH="100%">

<br><i>We'll see. I think there's enough material in here, that you have

dug out, to get us starting. Bots'behaviour can follow quite different

parameters on the various moronical advertisement web-sites, and can moreover

be easily modified. It would not wonder me if they will start checking

WHAT people have found out to avouid their dirty banners in order to better

defend them :-( Well, I guess it's the usual 'evolutionary' aspect of the

Web. We'll anyway always win because what we do, we do for passion and

for knowledge's sake, not for money.</i>
