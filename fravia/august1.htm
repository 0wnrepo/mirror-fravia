<FONT size=+3><FONT color=BLUE>August 1999<BR>HOLY HOLYDAYS!</FONT><BR></FONT><HR><FONT size=+1>I'm going now to enjoy some holydays: 

site-updates will therefore slow up, since I'll mostly lay indifferent, inactive and 

inert in the shadow. This does not mean you are all allowed to be sluggish, slowpokes or slothful in your reversing activities, nor lackadaisical, lazy or lethargic writing and sending your essays!<BR>

You may contact +gthorne for any 

urgent matter. Thanks, have a good month (and write and send some great essays!)
