take a look at this;  see if it's too esoteric for yer

audience; change the title and subtitle if desired.

<br></font><bR><center>

Quite esoteric for my audience, I would say... I'll publish this nevertheless, 

maybe there's more than eyes can see and my limited zen can feel (even if not much IMO... time will judge :-)<br><br>

The reason I decided to publish is that among the following 'esoterical' approach there 

dwells a quite good definition (IMO) of what a <b>real</b> stalker attitude should be.<br>

So I published it, <font color=blue>aZh nAZg the Troll</font> :-)<bR>...now let's hope we'll 'endlich' 

see (and possibly zen-touch :-) some 

<u>real stalking deeds</u> asap, that's the bare <u>minimum</u> 

you should accomplish after having written this (nice but 'nichtssagend') 'prelude'...<br>

<font color=purple> clarity

generates inner stillness, and inner stillness generates right action</font><br>

Of course, but if I may agree (I may) that right action should not be heard 

nor noticed, in the stillness of the forest, I cannot agree with the fact that it 

will not be <u>remembered</u>. Because history, not stalking, is the real dark mirror of the future  

that should be conquered, else humans will always remain just toys of some crooks or 

of fate (and fate is a lousy evil crook that should be reversed in its own, I believe :-)<br> 

And those 'right actions' wont be remembered, dear stalkers, 

unless you do take care to document them -at least in part- allowing 

many other (potential) truth seekers 

to see and understand such "tectonical" mighty shifts... therefore the very purpose of these 

'right actions' of ours cannot be fullfilled if they have to die with our 

selfish brains... 

else the aforementioned action was not "right" after all... 

it was just "action", whatever some black wizards I know (and even like) 

may believe... Behold! The garbage-cans of history are full of useless 'right actions'...

'the lights begin to twinkle from the rocks. the cold

moon shines. 

the surf booms forth with many voices. come now my

friends, one final

song before we go.  for my purpose holds: to sail into

the sunset, and

the baths of all the western stars, until i die' --

tennyson

</B></CENTER></P>

<P>

i realize, of course, that what i am saying to you

here will

immediately be forgotten. there is no hope, no

possiblity, for the

most of you of remembering what i have to say, for you

are not yet

united with me in in zen mind, and the shock i will

give you will last

only as long as you are reading these words.  but if

you be a true

seeker, you will return to these words again and

again, reiterating

the lesson, until such a day as you will be able

conciously to

remember, in every waking and dreaming hour. there be

of course a

scant few to whom my message will ring clear as a

bell;  to those i

say, hail fellow and well met, the more power to you,

friend, and

blessed be.

</P>

<P>

were i to speak you Truth, you would not believe me; 

you paint pretty

pictures inside your eyeballs of a world imagined,

seen as though in a

dream, and yet deemed real;  you listen to the story

tellers and are

enraptured by their glamour: they speak of deeds and

of treasures

beyond compare, out of reach of mere mortals;  they

incite you to

impossible feats and so enslave you to those reputed

to have performed

such.  i say unto you, heed not the storytellers;  any

deeds worth

mentioning have

never been uttered unto the light of day;  the only

treasure worth

seeking is freedom, and it can be had for the taking,

without

suffering or strife.

</P>

<P><B>

here now our dialog: 

</B></P>

<P>

outside of time, outside of thought, there is a place,

a place of

stillness, of becoming.  to sit there and observe, oh

how delightful. 

it is there that all you consider real manifests from.

 i tell you, i

sit there, and watch, and wait.  what do i wait for? 

i will tell you:

at the end of time, there lurks an Eater, that eats

awareness.  it

strips from you your memories, your deeds, and your

ambitions.

when a person arrives at the end of time, they light

up all their

being in a flash, they do a dance for the Eater, in

the hopes it will

be pleased, for there is a rumor, that should the

Eater be pleased it

will let you keep your awareness, and depart

unscathed.  they dance

and dance, and put their all into it, and if the Eater

is not pleased,

you shall be devoured.

</P>

<P>

mere mortals never escape.  only those that be

stalkers, hunters or

seekers may possibly have a chance of pleasing the

Eater.  mere

mortals have nothing that would interest it; their

humdrum lives are

all the same, analogous to one another, of no

particular import.  the

hunter on the other hand, poses a problem for the

Eater, for they

exist almost outside of Time already, in their own

dimensions, and

could possibly slip by unnoticed.  'hiding in

shadows', the art of the

ninja, so, hiding within folds of reality, becoming

part of the

scenery, a true stalkers achievement.

</P>

<P><B>

the mood of the stalker: 

</B></P>

<P>

know what i know now: a master's actions are final;

there is no

turning back, no redoing or undoing what is done, no

regrets, no fears

of reprisals;  being aware of the existence of the

Eater, and

comparing mortal trials and tribulations to that; i

take

responsibility for my actions;  there is no fear;

there are no doubts;

i do as i must, as is my predilection.  any action not

worth doing, i

do not, any step not on 

my path, i do not take;  all that i do, i do as though

they were my

last act on this earth.  such is the mood of the

stalker, the mood of

azh nazg.

</P>

<P>

we discourse with metaphor, for what i am telling you,

comes before

language or words.  you must learn to feel what i am

telling you;  if

you do that we will be on the same page, and have no

need for words. 

the words muddy the definition, as all persons have

different meanings

for words, based on their experience.  i show you a

dog, and think

helper, but you see a dog and think hunger.

</P>

<P>

in Truth, meaning is clarity, and language does not

exist.  in subset

Truth, language can convey meaning.  we are talking

about stalking

prey and stalking oneself. that is subset Truth;

therefore we can talk

about it.  but remain aware and remember the greater

truth that is

superset to what we are discussing.  remember well and

i will meet you

there again.

</P>

<P>

the difference between stalker and prey, is stalker

does not think

like prey.  prey thinks fear and evading and self

interest.  stalker

thinks stillness and listening and adapting.  to be

stalker and be

stalked and not become prey is ultimate challenge. in

the world there

be many stalkers who would turn you into prey, but

learn to not

succumb to them.  one trick of stalkers is to get prey

to fall into

trap of predictable

routines. what do i mean by that?  well, if you can

predict the

routine of your prey you can set up an ambush that

they will walk

right into.  part of stalking is to learn the patterns

in your prey's

behaviour, while doing the same to yourself, such that

you wind up not

having patterns in your behaviour.

</P>

<P>

know, and know it well, there is the Known, the

Unknown, and the

Unknowable. if cosmos is a table, and the known is a

salt shaker, it

is on the table.  the Unknown a pepper shaker and it

is on the table

as well, but the Unknowable, is what is not on the

table.  to truly

seek, stalk or hunt, you must seek the Unknowable, as

that is what

will lead to clarity.  the Eater is a part of the

Unknowable.  we

hunters know

and are aware that the Eater is unknowable, but we

carry on despite

that and have no remorse or hesitation.  that imho is

the true essence

of humanity: to know ones place and laugh in the face

of the Unknowable.

</P>

<P>

when you go stalking power, you need to make yourself

available to it,

so it can find you.  but be careful, the difference

between an

ordinary man and a hunter, is the ordinary man is

always available, to

everyone around them, and they get caught up in ties

to everyone else.

 if you're a hunter, you make yourself available only

to those things

that you are stalking.  you do this by creating a

little fog around

you,  that confuses the average man looking at it,

such that they

cannot tell if you are coming or going.

</P>

<P>

a stalkers life is regulated and orderly.  the average

man is

constantly swinging here and there, touching on this

and that, in no

apparent order.  that is a total waste of energy.  you

need to learn

to stay focussed on your goals.  you do this by

stalking yourself:

observing in detail the habits you have formed, and

one by one

eliminating them until you have no more habits.  the

difference

between the hunter and the prey is that the prey has

habits and the

hunter has none.

</P>

<P>

if you are alone in the deep dark (code)woods, and you

stay perfectly

still, at center and in equipoise, you will begin to

hear and feel the

world.  and prey and other hunters will impinge upon

you by breaking

the stillness, for with their movement through the

underbrush, the

natural randomness is broken.  prey move loudly and

constantly,

hunters will move almost randomly, but both will make

noise. 

</P>

<P>

you need to split yourself, to model yourself, the

world and your

prey.  see how the 3 interact in the inner spaces, and

learn to

observe the same in the out there. the question is not

to become a

master at the art of stalking, the question is to

become master, and

the stalking will follow.  to find a right path, that

is the goal, and

let no one tell you what is right and what is wrong.

</P>

<P>

the nature of power is that it is given, by the world.

 a man has

merely to tap it, and it will flow through them. 

power comes and goes

of its own accord, accounting to no one.  what you

must learn is to

deal with its absence, by accumulating personal power,

by storing it

up, and carrying it around with you.

<P>

</P>

realize that everything is in flux: panta rei.  he who

is today a

hunter, was not always one such.  the world has a

memory.  if you

listen hard enough, you can tap that memory, and the

hunter-to-be who

will someday be a hunter will be revealed to you. 

connect with that

primordial hunter, and track them through their

changes, and you may

be astonished by who they have become.

</P>

<P>

stalking flows in many dimensions.  each dimension is a

degree-of-freedom, that the model may revolve around. 

turn the whole

schmagazz around and around in your visualization,

revolving around

all degrees of freedom, until your intuition clicks

and says: that's it.

</P>

<P>

practice leads to knowledge, knowledge to clarity, and

clarity to

power.  a hunter achieved a state of continual

clarity, and will not

do anything to mess that up. you can use this to

advantage, by

tempting the hunter, and seeing what they will not do.

 clarity

generates inner stillness, and inner stillness

generates right action. 

</P>

<P>

at the end, when all is said and done, there is One

Ring, azh nazg,

that 'in the  darkness', binds them: the darkness is

the absence of

light, of illumination, of  clarity;  the one ring is

the enlightened

self;  the binding is that which connects self to

clarity.
