<I>Well, another very interesting essay from a &quot;new&quot; collaborator... 

Timelock protection scheme, once more... this new &quot;breed&quot; of 

tl32v20.dll protection (timelock) must have been created as a 

consequence of our own work on these pages, which is pretty 

interesting... not all shareware authors have the courtesy of 

telling us that they learned from our site :-)</I></CENTER><HR size="6">

Here as65pp's letter to  the +HCU Caretakers (i.e. me and +gthorne :-)<I>

         <BR><BR>

Hi Fravia, Hi Greythorne <BR><BR>



I've followed your site for quite a while now and I 

have to say it's for sure the most interesting place on 

the net. Thank you for maintaining it for such a long 

time and giving us the chance to learn!<BR> I must admit 

that I'm not that excited about staring at huge 

code-listings for hours on end, so your &quot;dead-listing&quot; 

approach is definitely not for me.       <BR>

To be honest, I wasn't any good at maths in school either :(<BR>

Nevertheless I was able to crack some programs by using 

a bit of common-sense and imagination. This one is a 

good example:                                <BR></I><PRE>



- &quot;Fooling&quot; Diskeeper -

-----------------------



Diskeeper from Executive Software is a defragmentation 

tool for Windows NT, it can handle NTFS- and 

FAT-Partitions and comes in two flavours: a 

'lite'-version (free of charge) and a 'pro'-version 

(prices from around $200 to $1500 for the NT-Server 

version), the main difference being that the 

pro-version can defrag in the background. 

Now guess which version I wanted to use :)

A free 30-day-demo of the pro-version can be downloaded 

from their website at www.execsoft.com. 

As I fetched and installed it, I saw that one of the files 

copied was named tl32v20.dll :)))

Great, I thougt, this will be dead in two minutes. 

(See Xoanon's essay on how to crack this lame 

protection). I didn't plan to patch the whole dll, I 

just wanted to use SoftICE to sniff the correct 

'unlock-code' from memory, as I had done many times 

before. Generally I prefer not to change too much of 

the code, if I can avoid it. So I started Diskeeper and 

up comes the familiar Nagscreen with it's three 

buttons... But hey, where is the infamous 'Purchase' 

button gone? Nothing there just 'OK' &amp; 'Cancel'! The 

Nag-Text says something about contacting 

Executive-Software by phone if you would like to spend 

big bucks for their efforts (Ha!), but there is no 

option to 'Register by phone', as there normally would. 



What's going on here? In my opinion, the people at 

Executive-Software had read Xoanon's essay too (grin) 

and decided to be clever: 

&quot;Let's disable the 'purchase' option, so bad, bad cracker 

gets no chance to sniff our unlock-code&quot;. 

By looking a bit deeper on 'tl32v20.dll' you can see that 

it has a different size than usual (86.528 bytes to 91.648 

bytes for the regular version). 

So what do we have here? A crippled protection scheme! 

Nice one, this.



Think a (tiny) bit about it all:



-  tl32v20.dll has to be called by the main module (DkWork.exe)

-  there are two copys of the dll installed by the program, one in 

   the main program directory and another one in the \defrag subdir

	IMPORTANT: If you haven't installed any Timelock-software before, 

        it is possible that another copy will be installed in the \WINNT 

        directory. 

        This wasn't the case on my machine, as I already had a 'uncrippled' 

        tl32v20.dll (91.648 bytes) from an earlier Timelock-protected 

        software (Boundschecker 5.0).

-  most likely, 'dkwork.exe' will call 'tl32v20.dll' only by it's name 

   no size-checking)

-  the whole point of the missing 'Purchase' option is that, if you enter 

   the correct code, it will modify an existing '*.tsf' - file (different 

   for each product) and put the correct code in there. 

   If 'tl32v20.dll' is called the next time (by 'DkWork.exe') it will in 

   turn look for the '*.tsf' - file, check the code in it, and won't pop-up 

   anymore if the code is right.



Got it ?! Exactly! We just have to replace the crippled 

version of 'tl32v20.dll' with the uncrippled one (both 

copyes of it must be replaced), run the app (Now the 

purchase-button is right there where it should be, 

fine), sniff the correct code with SoftICE and Bang!: 							

Thank you for your purchase!



For some reason, after you've done all this and let 

Diskeeper defrag for the first time, it will pop up 

with a &quot;copy protect violation&quot;. You are then again 

presented with the Nagscreen - dont worry! Just enter 

the sniffed code for a second time and you'll be safe, 

it won't bother you again. I suppose this has something 

to do with the second copy of 'tl32v20.dll' in the 

\defrag - subdir, but that's only a guess.<HR></PRE><CENTER><IMG SRC="trainin7.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/trainin7.gif" ALT="training" ALIGN="center" WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="43" BORDER="0" VSPACE="0" HSPACE="0"></A>

<I>This is intended as +HCU (easy) exercise for 

beginners: EXPLAIN this point. Best explanation(s) will 

be inserted here with the name of the author(s) on 1 

Novemeber 1997, so don't rush, work deep: you have 

enough time to explain well this point (which is 

important)... send solutions to </I>fravia+ and/or  

+gthorne<HR><PRE>As you see there are three things needed to crack 

Diskeeper: 

- SoftICE for NT (3.0 or higher) to sniff the code 

  (you'll find it everywhere on the Net) 

- Xoanons essay about cracking the Timelock scheme 

  (read the others timelock essays too) 

- an 'uncrippled' copy of the Timelock-dll 

  (peruse your old &quot;magazines&quot; CD-roms or download any Timelock-protected 

  software (GeoBoy, Boundschecker, etc.) 

Small hint if you follow Xoanons essay: 'task' &amp; 'hwnd' won't work in NT 

(error: no LDT), so a reverse engineer has to use 'bpx getwindowtexta' instead.



Conclusion: Well, nothing special really, except that 

it is possible to crack without knowing much about 

Assembler and without risking to get lost in the dark 

codewoods - just by using your brain and trying to 

understand the protectionist's reasons. 

In a quite similar way I managed to avoid the whole checksum-stuff 

(far too complicated!) when cracking SoftICE 3.01 for NT, but that's a 

different story (and maybe not that interesting anymore since v3.20 is 

already out).



That's all folks - bye for now!
