Economic
Wargames, by Dal Timgar<BR><BR><BR>The following essay is about the
economic system of the world today.  One of my readers who
approves of the contents refers to "economic wargame" as a
metaphor. Much as I appreciate his approval, I disagree that
it is a metaphor.  This is the real deal. Let me give you a
metaphorical overview of my presentation.<BR><BR>The global
economy is a giant multilevel, multiplayer chess game.  It
is however, being played in the dark. The powers that be,
have the overhead lights switched off.  To have any chance
you need a flashlight, and that would still leave the
problems of learning the rules and developing your skills. 
It seems most people only have a vague idea that some game
is going on.  I hope this essay can be a candle, for ye who
curse the darkness.<BR>        <BR>                 NNP =
GNP - Dcap<BR><BR>This equation defines the Net National
Product (NNP).<BR>It is equated to Gross National Product
(GNP) minus Depreciation of CAPital goods (Dcap).  The
trouble with this equation is that depreciation of durable
consumer goods is missing.  Random House defines
depreciation thusly:<BR><BR>   1. a decrease in value due to
wear and tear, decay, decline in price, etc.<BR>   2. U.S.
such a decrease as allowed in computing the value of
property for tax purposes.<BR><BR>The fourth edition of
Macroeconomics by Robert J. Barro of Harvard University
defines depreciation as:<BR><BR>  The wearing out of CAPITAL
goods over time, often expressed as a fraction of the stock
of capital.<BR><BR>When a car rental company buys
automobiles, it contributes to the GNP and therefore NNP. 
The same applies to cars purchased by consumers.  However,
as consumer autos deteriorate over the years the
depreciation is ignored, while that of capital goods is
registered on the income tax forms of businesses. Although
economists have no direct method of obtaining Depreciation
of Consumer goods (Dcon), to pretend it doesn't exist when
it must be a rather large amount is absurd.  How many
billions of dollars worth of cars, refrigerators, stoves,
air-conditioners, etc., etc. have American consumers trashed
since the end of World War II?  So the equation should
be:<BR><BR>            NNP = GNP - (Dcap + Dcon)<BR><BR>Our
economists are pulling a "Bill Clinton" on us. Limiting the
definition of depreciation in a way that makes economic
losses to the average man disappear into space.<BR><BR>We
live in a culture that has used complex machines for 300
years.  The first patent on a steam machine, number 356, was
issued in 1698.  Engineers can test, measure and specify the
failure rate of mechanical and	electronic devices.  A graph
of the failure rate over time of a machine follows a pattern
known as a bathtub	curve.<BR><BR>\ Infant Mortality                           
_-~<BR> \                                         _-~ <BR> 
\         Useful Life             _____-~   <BR>  
\__----------------~~~~~~~~~~~~~~         <BR>   MTBF					
wear out<BR>              time ------->		  peroid<BR><BR>The
curve gets its name from the obvious similarity to the
cross-section of a bathtub cut lengthwise up the middle.  It
starts with a high failure rate dropping rapidly to a
minimum. This is when the machine is new and has a high
probability of manufacturing defects. The failures during
this time are similar to birth defects and are also known as
infant mortality. The low point on the curve is where the
device is least unreliable and the Mean Time Between Failure
(MTBF) is computed. The failure rate remains low for an
extended period then rises quickly when the device begins to
wear out.<BR><BR>So what does the failure rate of machines
have to do with depreciation of durable consumer goods?  In
classical economics it is common to assume that consumers
are rational, possibly for simplicity's sake.  But how can
rational decisions be made with incomplete information?  The
only consumer products for which I have ever seen MTBF data
are disk drives for computers. Since computers have been
primarily used in businesses and losing data from hard disks
causes serious problems, supplying reliability data on hard
drives is traditional.  Where is the reliability data on
other consumer products?  What about cars, televisions,
VCR's?  How are we supposed to make these rational
decisions?  The best information I've seen is in Consumer
Reports.  They show graphs of failure rates by brand name
based on surveys of subscribers. They do not give
break-downs by model within brand and usually only cover
about eight brands of a product type. Are manufacturers
trying to maximize the useful life of their products?  If
not, are they engaged in planned depreciation, usually
called planned obsolesence?<BR><BR>In 1937 engineers at
Lockheed began designing a new fighter plane.  In January
1939 the first P-38 took to the air for testing to begin
eliminating design flaws.  The P-38 Lightning began service
in WWII in April '42, it had two supercharged 1400
horsepower, counter rotating engines, a cruising speed of
350 mph, a maximum of 414 mph and a ceiling of 44,000 feet.
The German's nicknamed it "The Fork-tailed Devil".  A
squadron of Lightnings shot down Admiral Yamamoto over the
Pacific in 1943.<BR><BR>Another child of Lockheed was
conceived in 1958.  It became the SR-71 Blackbird, a spy
plane instead of a war plane.  Its maximum speed is still
classified but is acknowledged as being capable of 2350 mph
at 80,000 feet.<BR><BR>If engineers were capable of these
feats 60 and 40 years ago, how can yearly variations in
machines that roll along the ground at less than 100 mph
possibly be exciting.  Going into debt to buy useless
variations in automobiles is economic insanity.  Retooling
factories to make parts that are shaped differently but not
technologically different increases the cost and therefore
the price of consumer products.  From 1908 to the mid 1920's
the Ford Motor Company made the same machine, the Model T. 
When introduced the Model T sold for $850.  By the time it
was discontinued in the mid '20's the price was less than
$300 and 15,000,000 had been manufactured.  If the
engineering capability that designed the Lightning had been
combined with manufacturing philosophy that produced the
Model T to manufacture cars in the '50's, how good a car, at
how low a price could have been sold by 1960?<BR><BR>In an
economic wargame society it is necessary to know how to keep
score and the tactics of the enemy. An individual's wealth
is indicated by his or her net worth. Net worth is assets
minus liabilities. Assets are anything which can be assigned
a monetary value that can be realized by selling the item. 
Liabilities are debts which have to be paid eventually. So
maximizing assets and minimizing liabilities are basic
objectives.  However, all assets are not created equal. Some
assets maintain or even increase their value over time while
others leak like a sieve. If an asset is so expensive one
has to go into debt to purchase it, then it is important to
know how long the asset lasts; how rapidly it depreciates.
Financial advisors tell us that a home is the most expensive
purchase that most Americans ever make, followed by
automobiles.  Hopefully the value of ones home will increase
but the value of a car can only decrease. By not supplying
reliability and durability data on their products auto
makers are leaving consumers in the dark and engaging in
information hiding.<BR><BR>If auto manufacturers produced
lower cost, longer<BR>lasting cars by eliminating useless
design and brand variations (Chevys and Pontiacs are both by
General Motors), then the savings on cars could be applied
to home mortgages.  A $100,000 mortgage over 30 years at 8%
will ultimately cost $264,153.60, that's $164,153 in
interest alone.  By paying an additional amount each month a
mortgagee can reduce the total interest paid and eliminate
years of payments.<BR><BR>Regular Payment: $733.76  Total

9........ 88,262.94<BR><BR>Paying an extra $200/mo. nearly
cuts the time in debt in half while saving $88,000 in
interest.  But the money for that extra payment has to come
from somewhere. Cars and credit cards are two
possibilities.<BR><BR>In 1983 I read a letter that a bank
sent to its<BR>stockholders.  The bank informed its owners
that it encouraged the customers to take as long as possible
to pay back their loans.  This will of course maximize the
time over which interest is charged, thereby maximizing the
dividends to the stockholders.  My bank recently sent me a
credit card bill of $0.00 even though it should have been
over $100.  Their<BR>explanation was:<BR><BR>    "There is
no minimum payment due because lastmonth's payment exceeded
the minimum payment due. Your normal payment schedule will
resume nextmonth. Finance charges will continue to accrue if
the new balance is not paid in full by the due
date."<BR><BR>They're content to charge me interest while
"graciously" allowing me to "save" money by not paying them
one month. Apparently I'm paying them faster than they would
prefer.  Making minimum payments on credit cards means being
in debt for years and paying 2 to 3 times the purchase price
for everything bought with the cards.<BR><BR>There is no
limit to how dumb consumers are expected to be, some company
named Providian keeps sending me an application for a Visa
"Classic".  It has a $500 limit, 23.99% interest, a $49
application fee, a $59 annual fee and they have the NERVE to
say it's a limited time offer.  It's the third time I've
gotten the offer, I don't see how it could get worse in the
future.  If some fool were to take this offer and make
minimum payments of 3% per month with this interest rate of
2% per month that would amount to approximately $180 + $49 +
$59 = $288 paid in the first year and still leave a bill of
$440.  How many dummies do they find every
month?<BR><BR>Buying "assets" that depreciate rapidly with
credit cards is screwing oneself coming and going, and the
stockholders get to laugh all the way to the bank.<BR><BR>In
the mid-1940's John von Neumann, a Hungarian-American
mathematician, began inventing and applying game theory to
economics.  This "game theory" seems to bestuck in academic
never-never land and is rarely mentioned in the real world. 
Lester Thurow, an MIT economist, made implications about it
in his book, "The Zero-Sum Society".  A zero-sum game is one
in which every gain by a "winner" is matched by an
equivalent loss by a "loser".  A bank's stockholders may be
winners while the credit card customers could be losers. One
man's liability is another man's asset. The global economic
wargame is virtually inescapable. If most worker/consumers
don't know how to keep score it is a good bet there are
going to be a lot of losers. According to one web site 50%
of Americans have a net worth of less than $10,000.  Two
independent sources claim that more than 60% of the people
that get bill consolidation loans to eliminate high interest
debt, proceed to charge up their credit cards
again.<BR><BR>The Bible says:<BR><BR>        The rich rule
over the poor,<BR>           and the borrower is the
slave<BR>              of the lender.<BR>                                
Proverbs 22:7<BR><BR>This bluntly states the power that
wealth gives to those who possess it.  To increase this
power banks send out millions of "slave" cards anually. The
famous statement, "Freedom requires constant<BR>vigilance"
is usually assumed to apply to political freedom but it is
even more applicable to economics. Having to make rent or
mortgage payments every month and possibly credit card
payments means maintaining a source of income, usually a
job.  Wargames are inherently unstable.  Companies get
bought, companies go out of business, jobs can be
lost.<BR><BR>Our educators constantly talk about preparing
students for the workforce though businessmen regularly
complain about potential employees not being sufficiently
skilled. Our colleges eagerly promote statistics which
indicate that higher education leads to higher salaries. 
That's fine for the income side of the equation but how much
attention is devoted to the expense side?  How many
high-school graduates know what net worth is, or understand
amortization schedules?  What good does it do if our
educators only create competent employees who then get
fleeced of their hard earned cash?  Or could it be that our
educators are another set of fleecers?  I once saw a TV
program which interviewed people who told employers they had
college degrees but had actually lied.  Many of them worked
for years, got raises and promotions. What do you need to
know to pretend you have a degree in psychology, or history,
or english literature?<BR>Spend a few months reading some
decent books and who'll know the difference?  Was it 60
Minutes?  I can't recall. Of course this was years ago and
cheap computers and telecommunication have probably made
verification of education much easier.  This may not work
today.  Could it be I'm getting too
cynical?...<BR>...Nahh!<BR><BR>I'm getting tired of typing
so before signing off I'll just suggest doing a little web
browsing to check stuff for yourself, like von Neumann and
game theory and P-38 Lightnings.  You might check out a few
books too:<BR><BR> The Screwing of the Average Man    
<BR>by David Hapgood<BR>out of print but still
locatable<BR><BR> Your Money or Your Life<BR>by Joe
Dominguez and Vicki Robin<BR>too pollyannaish but has its

War<BR>translated & edited Thomas Cleary<BR>more detailed
than the following, get this first<BR><BR> The Art of War 
by Sun Tzu  <BR>translated Thomas Cleary <BR>wargamers
training manual, time tested<BR><BR>So, to misquote that
Vulcan that never explained what it meant to prosper, "Live
long and good luck in the economic wargame".  No, that's no
good, Vulcans don't believe in luck. Make that, "Live long
and use killer tactics (in the economic wargame)".<BR><BR>
