MOVE THE  FORM AROUND TO READ THIS PAGE</FONT></FONT>

<BR><FONT size=+1>

ENTRANCE TO FRAVIA'S ADVANCED JAVASCRIPT PAGE</FONT></CENTER>

<BR>

<I>As you can see, on this page you have a typical Javascript access form 

 where you'll have to enter a password (duh) which will give you access to 

the advanced javascript page. Since the NAME of the advanced javascript page 

is directly related to the password, all failure will bring you back to my 

main page. Of course this IS NOT a <FONT color=blue>real web protection scheme</FONT>, since 

such 'cheap' tricks are relatively easy to circumvene, at least 

if you understand (or learn now) a little the javascript language and if you have 

at least a little cracker's stoff...<BR>

Nevertheless I hope that this page will help me

to make my point (in fact my didactical 'leit-motiv'): lamers should not and 

will not understand 

what's 

going on, yet the ones capable to study and to experiment a little, 

will not only go further on, but will also be able to use this same kind 

of trick (implementing and ameliorating it of course) in order to  

protect some 'delicate' parts of their sites... a nice present by fravia+ to anyone 

reading this, I believe... lets' 

hope that you'll at least give me some credit<BR>(I deserve only in part, since 

I have ripped part of the 

javascript code off a commercial smut site that I have busted (see my 

<A href="ideale.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/ideale.htm">antismut</A> pages if you want to learn the 

basic of site-nuking) and since I am NOT a nice guy when it comes to commercial 

smut sites, I <U>will not</U> give 

recognition to those bastards for the (parts) of the Javascript code

I have ripped off... OK, you have 4 tryes to land on my advanced javascript pages... 

see you there.



<!--

and here is what they wrote after a while... seems that 

somebody has being playing with their server :-)<pre><font color=purple>



ATT: We have suffered some periods of down time over the last few weeks 

due to SYN FLOODING attacks. This is a criminal offence, and we are working 

on tracing the criminals down will procecute them to the fullest extent of 

the law. They are not just effecting a server, but an entire network for which 

they will als be held accountable. We have expert techs working on it and 

although its costing me a HUGE amount of money - it will be worth it in the 

long term. After running strong for almost a year now, and after thosands 

of hours and dollars invested in our site, we are not about to shut it down. 

If we do go down again, for any length of time - please hang in there.</fonT></prE>
