Dear fravia+, 

Since the first time I started to explore the dedalous of what you call 

your fortress, I was baffle on how you manage to crystalise and give 

away such a huge amount of information. Although knowing nothing about 

reverse engineering, searching nor anonymity, nevertheless I became a 

regular (avid) visitor; slowly learning -mostly by osmosis. 

As I saw bright stars rising through various essays, I never thought I 

could be able one day to propose my little brick to your edifice :) 

Perhaps, this day has arrived. Thanks to you. 

Kind regards and be well. leFaF's "Configuring Netscape to use proxy"

 <HR size=1> <P>Here follow my "comments" on your seasonal feelings.<P>When I saw the very nice drawing on fravia+'s autumnal page, I was wondering

where I could be on the picture.<P>On the shore waving goodbye to the boat and its captain, well, no.

<BR>Under the sea swimming round and around big fishes, yet , no.

<BR>One of the personage, aboard the lean drakkar sailing away, this time

again, no.<P>And they were sailing away...<P>At this point, I started to realise that I had been just a spectator

entertained by what he and other freely gave away.

<BR>All of a sudden I felt like a peeping-tom.

<BR>A taker, not a giver.<P>And they were sailing away...<P>What can I do: I do not want to be left, I hate to be under, I cannot

be aboard... What is left?<P>Although obvious since the beginning, the answer finally came bright

and clear: give, share, participate.<P>All of a sudden I felt free, free as a bird...<P>I was flying away.

<BR>&nbsp;<P>But hey, wait, why should I surf anonymously and, by the way, what is

a proxy?

<BR>A scary answer can be found <A HREF="noanon.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/noanon.htm">here</A>.

To put is strait, when you are in the comfort of your computer room, all

alone with your machine, nobody knows what you are doing, right.

<BR>Wrong!

<BR>You splatter information about yourself all over the world. It's kind

of walking naked in a crowded boulevard with your ID card hanging on your

neck...

<BR>Oh!

<BR>On the Wild Web, there are nasty things like cookies, hostile applets

and java scripts, browser security holes, assholes, log files and much

more...

<BR>Septic? The Joker can tell you <A HREF="javascript:if(confirm('http://1194street.hypermart.net/joker/joker.cgi  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://1194street.hypermart.net/joker/joker.cgi'" tppabs="http://1194street.hypermart.net/joker/joker.cgi">here</A>

what he knows about you. And you, do you know him?

<BR>Surprising, isn't it?

<BR>Now you might desire to become a bit more invisible, aren't you? If

you do so, here are a few tips.<P><B>Cookies</B>

<BR>A simple way to refuse cookies is to change the attributes of the cookie

file to read-only. But delete the content first!

<BR>- In Netscape look for cookies.txt

<BR>- In Opera cookies.dat<P><B>Java Script</B>

<BR>As most java scripts are not really interesting, just turn this off.

<BR>- Netscape: Edit Menu - Preferences - Advanced - Unchecked Enable Java

and JavaScript

<BR>- Opera: Preferences Menu - Multimedia - Unchecked Authorize JavaScript<P><B>Proxy</B>

<BR>A proxy server is a machine dedicated to handle web accesses and store

copies of documents on a local disk. Proxy sits on a gateway and passes

traffic across it. So when you use a proxy with your browser, rather than

connecting to a web site directly, your

<BR>browser will make a connection to the proxy first. The proxy then opens

up a connection to the specified web site and forwards it back to your

browser. The web site will "see" the proxy IP address, not yours.

<BR>Besides, connecting to a large proxy may speed up your connection times

considerably.

<BR>But beware all proxies are not anonymous. Some may give out your IP

or a CGI script might find your IP behind the proxy.<P><B>Useful Proxy Related Links</B>

<P>Finally, here is a way to configure Netscape Communicator to surf anonymously

<BR>your choice. I use c:\Proxy\viaprox.pac in the example. 

<BR>The 3 proxies inserted are functional now (20.11.98) but you'd better find your own.

      As you have already noticed, the viaprox.pac at fravia/confnets has to be 

      somewhat adjusted to work properly.

      This little essay was done fast, and I have overseen some details. 

   

      Sorry for the fast _found it, take away, people_ who have missed 

      the ever evoluting process.

      For the other, take it as a challenge to do better.

      Anyway, the general idea was to use the file that ANY proxy 

      server use, right into your comfty PC.



      For the sake to go a bit further, here are two working (!?) pac 

      files for you to probe.



      ezeprox.pac will use the same cache for http, ftp and gopher.

      You just have to replace "proxy_u_like1&2.com" by the proxy of 

      your choice. If there are no proxy available,

      Netscape will ask if you want a direct connection.

      In dayprox.pac, the proxy -for http only- will change everyday. 

      Woody!



      Your comment, improvement and suggestion are most welcome.



      Be well
