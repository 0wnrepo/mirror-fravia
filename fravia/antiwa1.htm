I really don't

think you need to know

much (if anything) about assembler to do well in

shareware (and make a good

living for that matter) and make adequate protection.<BR><BR>

There are several

levels of protection, each with their own tradeoffs in

time spent on making

it, and protection they offer (balanced with the level

of protection you

need, something much overlooked!). To take my own

software: It has some

protection, one needs a registration key to make it

work. There have been

key generators out for it for ages, yet my sales have

only gone up over the

years and I certainly can't complain. The moral of

this story is that I

believe a bit of protection can go a long way in that

it makes people think

of registering and lots of them actually will. This in

contrast to having

no protection at all. Others have experimented with

releasing the exact

same program through different channels with the only

difference being one

stopped working after a while (and needed a key), the

other just had nag

screens telling users they really should register by

now. Turned out most

people will not register unless there is a compelling

reason to do so (ie.

it stops to work and they need a key). Of course, a

number of those in need

of a key will get it from a warez site, but my own

experience shows there's

still a large group that'll buy a key.

<BR><BR>

I'm moving to what I see as the next level of

protection, making it hard to

make key generators, and building in ways to block

stolen keys in

subsequent releases. This can be done using public key

encryption, and

doesn't require assembler at all. The consequence is

that to crack the

program the warez scene has to bring out patches

rather than just release

keys. This is a whole different ballgame, and far

fewer user will want to

run a patch vs. typing in a fake key.

<BR><BR>

Beyond this one can add more and more code to make

debugging/disassembling/patching the software harder

and harder. While

interesting, this is a game of lesser and lesser

returns for time invested.

There are always going to be those with more time on

their hands than you

have, who crack it. Personally I'm more interested in

spending that time in

furthering my business, and believe that yields more

(monetary) returns

when compared to spending it on coding the ultimate

protection.

<BR><BR>

There you have it!

My views on software protection. Of

course, feel free to

disagree...

I work as a programmer in a large company with several hundred 

employees, I have briefly mentioned cracks around the office, I 

have found that most people don't even know what it means.<BR>They 

think you're talking about some kind of drug.<BR><BR>

The few that have heard the term told me it wasn't worth the bother 

to try to find a crack. They'd just rather pay for it and be done. I 

know maybe three people in our company who look for cracks.<BR><BR> 

From what I've been told some people spend days and weeks even 

looking for crack for $15.00 shareware program. Now when you 

consider that the guys are making 30plus an hour it sorta of 

doesn't make sense does it?<BR>  <BR>

For the most part, most people I know say programs are cheap 

enough that the time searching for a crack especially if its going to 

take a long time just isn't worth it.<BR> <BR>

Frankly I think the time spent on writing better protection would be 

more helpful than trying to shut down a crack site for a few days 

and we all know that's all you will succeed in doing.<BR><BR>

I don't think its worth the effort. Better to spend the time on making 

a better program with a tougher code to crack.<BR><BR>

 there are examples on Fravias pages which describe

                how

to put markers in C/C++ code. the markers are byte

 sequences which will never produced by a compiler.

                you

 just use asm / emit to put them where you need them.

 then, you write a little app to scan for these

 markers, do a checksum between them and store that

 checksum somewhere. it's fun and easy. <BR><BR>

 <B>Fravia+</B><BR>

 Yep, -c, yet I hope you understand that this

                approach

 can ALSO be easily reversed. The problem is the

 "somewhere" in your assumption. 

<B>Chris</B><BR><BR>

                        yep.<BR><BR>



                        still, it's always good to have yet-another trap for

                crackers to

                fall into. 

<BR><BR>

                        and, the nicest thing to do with the fileCRC!=appCRC

                info is to not

                put up dialog box and yell at the user, but to do

                something subtle like :

<BR><BR>

                        a) reset the user parameters<BR>

                        b) corrupt the data in subtle ways <BR>

                        c) start a (long, 5 minute) timer, shut down when the

                timer goes off<BR>

                        d) refuse to print certain things<BR>

                        e) write random data to the middle of the EXE<BR>

                        etc..<BR><BR>



                        the point is, if the app has been modified, <U>you don't

                have to be

                nice to the user</U>. and, you don't have to make it easy

                for the cracker to

                know that the app even does a CRC on itself. just

                cruise along nicely, make

                the cracker think everything is fine. maybe he'll even

                distribute the crack

                he's made. people will use the crack, and the app

                won't work. 

<BR><BR>

                        remember, you don't have to be nice to crackers, or

                people using

                cracks - they aren't nice to you.

<BR><BR>

                        -c
