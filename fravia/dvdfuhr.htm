"DIVX and DVD reversing"<BR>by Dr. Fuhrball's<BR>23 September 1998<BR>(slightly edited by fravia+)

<HR>

Well, this is a very interesting essay. Dr. Fuhrball joins a sound reversing approach 

(and protection busting) with a broader analysis that borders to reality 

cracking. I have included it into the +HCU papers, because I believe that 

'domestic appliances' cracking will be more and more a fundamental part of 

any applied reverse engineering study...

   DVD, DIVX and MACROVISION



   Zoran Softdvd, Creative Pc-Dvd Encore, Zenith 2100 DIVX player...



   By Dr. Fuhrball



   (Some of this is not done yet, i just do not have the time i used to!)

   (No Fravia+... its not because i am watching too much TV, these days i

   watch less than two hours a week!)



   This weeks cocktail:   Cadenheads Longmorn Glenlivet. Delivered at

   full cask strength of 120 proof. Whoaboy is this stuff good. And along

   with it a monte-cristo from Havana (&#161;Que linda es Cuba!). (What you say? 

   Havana cigars are illegal in USA? Really?)



   How the motion picture industry wants to screw your butt,

   over and over and over and over.....





   DVD, the Digital Versatile disk. Used to be Digital Video disk, but

   they found a bunch more uses for it. Up to 4 layers on a dual sided

   disk the same size as a cd, with up to about 18GB.



   But could they leave this alone, no way. First they had to find a way

   to protect their valuable films. Along came "regional" control. Now this

   really pisses me off, because when i buy a video disk, i want to be

   able to play it. When I go to Japan and buy a "region 2 disk", then bring

   it back to the Usa, it will not play, because a region 2 disk generates

   an authentication error on a "region 1" player. Will I tolerate this,

   of course not. Lots of ways to go about it.

<A name="zora"></A>

   The first way is Zoran Softdvd.

   This is a software only product that with appropriate hardware

   in this case a pII/400 and an ATI AGP video card, this software product

   plays DVD's at full frame rate with stereo sound. Kind of slick

   actually.

   Kind of buggy really. This version is 1.61. One small exe file and

   a bunch of huge dll's. Take a look at the following segment.





   CCE_SPU.DLL

   I think you all know what to do with the two jumps at

   44A1 and 4589



   But there is still one little detail. Even though we have now

   got rid of all authentication control, The ntsc video output on the

   ATI video card has macrovision applied to it, courtesy of the

   impacTV2 ntsc output chip. Now this is buried in the code somewhere,

   that i have yet to be able to find.





   Is macrovision a problem. Do not think so.

   I was going to include a schematic for a macrovision decoder, but

   with numerous outfits on the net selling them for $60 USD, its not

   worth building one.



   check out videotek.net





   However soon, there will be players with a newer version of the macrovision

   circuit thats much harder to defeat. But here is the best part, not

   only is the new encoding circuit patented, but macrovision also patented

   the decoding circuit, so that anyone producing macrovision decoder boxes

   could (and most likely will be) sued. Nasty people aren't they. After

   obtaining a copy of the patent, its obvious that the newest idea is to not 

   only to mess with the sync signals, but to slowly and rhythmitically modify

   slightly the frequency and phase of the color burst signal. Does not affect

   standard viewing (Bullshit it don't) but drives VCR's nuts.



   Lots of tapes and DVD's and PPV events on DSS have macrovision enabled.

   People start voting on this with your pocket book. Are you going to

   spend 5K on an HDTV monitor, only to have the picture screwed with by

   macrovision?



   Here is the same think for the pc-dvd encore unit.

   This uses a dedicated mpeg video decoder board with the Ccube chipset

   on it.

   I could dissasemble and patch this mess, but someone else has already

   done a really good job of creating a universal gizmotron to do it.

In january 1998 I (Erwin van den Berg) made a small utility that 

could change the region code of the Creative DVD Encore Dxr2. 

This program was called the Creative DVD Region Selector (REGION.EXE). 

Later, when the program also could change the color carrier of 

the tv output and disable MacroVision, the name was changed in 

Creative DVD Selector (SELECTOR.EXE).

</FONT><HR width=33% height=5>If you want this program right now (version 1.31), just email 

<A href="mailto:getweb@usa.healthnet.org">getweb@usa.healthnet.org</A>

(where %7E corresponds to the "tilde" ~ of the above URL)

<HR>

   <PRE>Whats really slick about this method, is that it touches NONE of the

   original code. It just intercepts things...



   There are most certainly other ways.



   Modify the drive itself to always spit back the non-copyrighted, multi

   region label. On some drives this could be slightly tough.



   For most panasonic and pioneer players there are already numerous

   outfits out there selling what amounts to new firmware that disables

   all regional controls and macrovision. Prices are currently a little 

   high but will definitely come down as volume increases.



   Modify the operating system DVD device driver.

   Now this one is a bit of work. With windows98 its built into the

   operating system. One patch will fix most drives.



   This is what i will be spending much time on in the future.

<HR>

   Now on to more fun.

   The Zenith DIVX player.



   Now I really hope that DIVX actually fails BIGTIME real soon. 

   Absolutely everything about DIVX is bad.



   quoting from various sources...



   Under Divx, consumers would pay about $5 for a DVD-quality movie - a

   far lower price than today's standard DVDs, which often retail for up to

   $26. But unlike today's DVDs, the Divx movie could be played for only

   two days, and only on a Divx-equipped player. After that, the movie

   would be scrambled. 



   For additional viewings, consumers would pay additional fees which could

   vary from film to film. Divx-equipped players, connected to phone lines,

   would unscramble the film and pass information along to a central office

   that would bill the consumer. 



   Sounds like a good idea, think again. Whats the average life of a CD

   player. In my house its ready for the trash can in 4 years. That means

   that if you spend the full price for the movie, you can ONLY watch that

   movie in THAT player. When the player breaks, your investment goes

   away. If i take a movie over to a friends house which i now legally own,

   it will NOT play in his player.



   What else would you expect from a bunch of lawyers working for

   Circuit City corporate.



   Others have listed the disadvantages much more accurately.



   Some of this should go in under the reality cracking section.





   1.    The Divx players will cost 100-200$ more than ordinary DVD players and

         thus putting them even more out of reach for those preferring to

         rent and not to buy.

   2.    You will also have the extra expense of installing permanent telephone

         lines to all your Divx players. No other electonic devices used in the

         homes needs a permanent telephone connection. 

   3.    The rental fee will be higher than that of ordinary DVDs. 

   4.    Many people will throw away the Divx disc after the first wieving as

         the plastic disc is then worthless. This in not exactly environmentally

         safe.

   5.    Divx will mean that several hundred thousand DVD players are outdated

         just a few months after the DVD launch.

   6.    Launching a competing format will confuse the consumers and confused

         consumers will not buy anything. The entire launch of DVD will be

         delayed worldwide. The delay may be so long that it comes too close

         too the launch of the next DVD generation with HDTV resolution.

   7.    Many average consumers will not understand that the Divx disc they

         buy can't be played in any DVD player and they will also have problems

         understanding the rental system. Less honest people will take advantage

         of the confusion and sell Divx discs as used DVDs.

   8.    Paying full price to get an unlimited rental period will not be

         possible with all titles. Try to calculate what 1 year of Lion King

         would cost and try to imagine explaining to the kids that they can't

         see the title even if it's on your bookshelf.

   9.    You can't sell your Divx movies even if you have paid Divx full price

         to "own" the titles.

   10.   If you take a Divx disc you "own" over to a friend not only does he

         need to have a Divx player, he will also have to pay a 48 hour rental

         fee to play the disc. 

   11.   It will not be possible to show a part of a scene on a Divx disc to

         demo the new digital video format without having to pay a full 48 hour

         period for it. 

   12.   Imagine if the babysitter would take a short peek (Looking for cool

         menus and extras) at 50 of the movies in your collection that you do

         not yet "own". 

   13.   "Hey, this is the wrong film!" How many times have you put the wrong

         VHS or CD into a player? That error will now cost you a 48 hour

         rental. 

   14.   If another company buys the rights to a movie or if Disney again put

         one title on moratorium expect that a Divx disc you have paid full

         price for can suddenly become unwatchable. 

   15.   Divx claims that their system will survey the consumer no more than

         that of an ordinary video rental store will do. This is not true. With

         Divx they will have to keep track every title you (or anyone else) put

         into your video player from the day you open the Divx account and that

         no matter the origin of the disc. They will even know what time of day

         you are viewing the title.

   16.   The Divx discs will be numerated so if you take your disc over to a

         friend who also happends to have a Divx player the Divx central will

         know it. Divx have already said they will use this information. Maybe

         you don't care about being surveyed, but imagine getting a call from a

         pizza company every time a Divx is put into a player it don't "belong"

         to.(In case you don't understand this: When a Divx disc in put into

         another player chances are that several friends are gathered to watch

         a movie. A pizza company may be willing to pay Divx for this

         information). 

   17.   Only the manufacturers selling the lowest quality players supports Divx. 

   18.   You will not be able of using the cool extras that many titles will

         have on a computer with a DVD-ROM player.

   19.   With Divx you will only be able of renting from one company. If the

         format gets accepted among the consumers they will have a monopoly

         and can set the prices without any competition. 

   20.   If Divx is accepted they will take over the market from specialised

         video stores who will have to close. The profit margin they can get

         from selling Divx discs are simply not enough for them. How many rare

         movie titles do you expect to find at the local grocery store if they

         start to sell Divx there? Contrary to the claims Divx will mean that

         the consumers will have less titles to choose from as it will kill

         nearly all specialzed video stores. Apart from less choice many jobs

         would also be lost.

   21.   If Divx is accepted they could also offer rentals at higher price at

         the same time as the movies passes at the movie theatres. Divx could

         kill your local cinema. 

   22.   No information system is without errors. What if you find that you

         are charged for viewing a disc you know you have not seen the last

         month. How can you prove it to them? If you refuse to pay they may

         simply disable your Divx account.

   23.   What will you do when they start charging you a monthly fee for having

         a Divx account? Will you pay whatever they ask or will you throw

         away the film collection they claimed you "owned"? 

   24.   No credit card or no phone? Forget it! 

   25.   If your check account is not ballanced then Divx may stop your Divx

         account and you will suddenly find yourself unable of viewing the

         entire movie collection you have already paid full price for. 

   26.   What will happend if your phone line is down for several days, if

         angry DVD owners are blocking the tollfree numbers or simply if you

         go on vacation for a week or more and you are not willing to leave

         the player connected?

   27.   The system could also be used to monitor all DVD and CD titles you

         play on the Divx player.

   28.   If you move to another country your entire movie collection would

         become worthless.

   29.   People will simply not accept paying each time they view a title they

         have in their house. They would simply copy it to VHS using a

         macrovision buster. It would even be fully legal for the consumers to

         do this. How do you expect the studios to cover their loss?

   30.   What will you do with the collection of Divx discs you "own" if/when

         the whole Divx project is stopped? Do you expect that you can still

         watch a Divx disc you "own" 15 year from now just as you can with

         VHS, Laserdisc and ordinary DVD?

   31.   If Divx succeeds expect similar systems to be used for DVD-ROM and

         DVD-Audio. By releasing software only on a Divx system they hope

         to push the consumers into supporting this more expensive rental system. 

   32.   In a few years DVD-RAM could be used to record TV programmes and

         replace the VCR completely. If the player also has Divx don't

         expect the studios not to take advantage of having control of your

         player.

   33.   No matter how impressive the encryption is there will always be a

         loophole. To modify a Divx player so it "forgets" it has played a disc

         should not be too big a challenge for many crackers. Expect such players

         to become mainstream in the USA and the rest of the world if Divx

         by any chance takes off in the USA. Remember that the Circuit City

         chairman Richard Sharp warned that early adopters were taking a risk.

         This is indeed true with Divx. If Divx is not killed right after the

         launch expect a new system called something like Divx-2 soon to be

         launched rendering the old Divx players outdated.  





   Now lets pay attention to #33. Lets take a DIVX disk and stick it in a

   regular computer DVD player. Lets open the disk with explorer. Oh,

   lookie it looks just like a regular dvd disk. Lets open softdvd and try to play

   the disk. "Not a MPEG data stream". So its encrypted. I do not believe

   that cracking this is gonna be that tough. It cannot be tough, there is just

   barely enough time to run the mpeg decoder anyway. If anything its a

   masking or rotating bit shifting thing.



   Now lets crack open that Zenith DIVX player i have gotten my hands on.

   Make no mistake about it, the only thing Zenith owns about the entire thing

   is the logo on the front. Its actually made by Goldstar. Zenith engineers

   would be incapable of designing anything like this anyway, thats if

   there were any engineers left after the recent chapter 11 filing....



   Oh, look a 32,768 khz watch crystal. Naw, can't be that easy.

   First never ever hook this thing to the phone line. Without being on

   the phone line, it can never update the time. Now either short the

   two wires of the crystal together, or tie one wire to ground. The

   clock stops. Turn the unit back on, beep, beep ,beep. Turn the unit

   back off, install a switch. Turn the unit back on, comes up fine.

   Now turn on the switch stoping the clock. If you leave the unit in this

   condition, you can play DIVX disks, damm near forever. Now one would

   normally think that there is got to be a hidden gotcha here, like the

   player timing out after not being able to reach the authorization

   center for a week, But this now 3+ weeks running, and no problem yet.

   (Of course this is a BETA player, and they will probably fix it, then

   again maybe not.) On the other hand it may be that they use the clock

   to determine cheaper times to call in, and since the clock never advances

   then the player does not call in. Given #10 above, it would seem that

   they are not worried about the ocassional possibility of one person

   watching a movie, then immediately taking it over to another persons

   house so that he can watch it...



   Actually the phone company will probably love divx, think of all that

   additional revenue from all those boxes calling in all the time.



   Its now 5 weeks later, and the divx player continues to play disks that

   have not been paid for. Sears a large retailer in the USA has dropped

   selling divx, saying that they do not want consumer backash to divx to

   affect other parts of their store.
