Reverse engineering a program you have legitimately bought and studying or modifying 



its code is perfectly LEGAL, at 



least in the European Union, as long as<BR>



* You do it only for your personal use or for "educational purposes" (i.e. study)<BR>



* You do not use big chunks of the code for applications you SELL<BR>



You may for instance completely 



modify Wordpad for your personal use, as I did, in order to have as defaults *.txt, 



*.alf and *.asm instead of the almost useless *.doc<BR>You may rip off whatever code 



you want from whichever application you want in order to use it, modify it, squash it 



with a mace or throw it away :-)<BR><BR>



Well, let's demonstrate it... here is the law:<BR><BR><CENTER>

Article 6: Decompilation 



1. The authorization of the rightholder shall not be required where reproduction of the 

   code and translation of its form within the meaning of Article 4 (a) and (b) are 

   indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the interoperability 

   of an independently created computer program with other programs, provided that 

   the following conditions are met:...

</PRE></FONT>

<I>This, translated, means that you do not need "the authorization of the rightholder" like you would for  4a (temporary 

reproduction of a program) or 4b (translation, adaption, arrangement and any other alteration of a program) if this is 

necessary to debug and/or run the crap you have bought. The "following conditions" are that you do it yourself and 

only insofern as you deem to need it really.<BR><BR>Note -what's even MORE important for reverse engineering- that 

at article 5 there are some EXCEPTIONS to  

the restricted acts:<BR>

</I><FONT color=purple><PRE>

Article 5:  Exceptions to the restricted acts 



1. In the absence of specific contractual provisions, the acts referred to in 

   Article 4 (a) and (b) shall not require authorization by the rightholder 

   where they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful 

   acquirer in accordance with its intended purpose, including for error correction. 



2. The making of a back-up copy by a person having a right to use the 

   computer program may not be prevented by contract insofar as it is 

   necessary for that use. 



3. The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be 

   entitled, without the authorization of the rightholder, to observe, study 

   or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas 

   and principles which underlie any element of the program if he does so 

   while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, 

   transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do.

</PRE></FONT><BR><I>

Quite right! Obviously there cannot be a "looking under the cover is forbidden" policy, which would lame all 

technical development (it's already lamed enough like it is now), 

therefore you may observe, study or test 

the functioning of any program you fancy (the reason is 

that they could not have forbidden it anyway :-) sipping your favourite Martini<BR>

There is another point at art.7.1.(c) that refers to "technical devices which may have been applied to protect 

a computer program", which could be of interest for us:</I>

<FONT color=purple><PRE>

...Member States shall provide, in accordance with their national

legislation, appropriate remedies against a person committing... 



     (c) any act of putting into circulation, or the possession for commercial purposes 

   of, any means the sole intended  purpose of which is to facilitate the unauthorized 

   removal or circumvention of any technical device which may have been applied to 

   protect a computer program.</PRE><BR></FONT><I>

But this refers -at most- to dongles-cracking and it is clearly intended for mass-burning of pirated cd-roms (which BTW is a 

big industry in the far East and in the Ex-Yugoslavian Lilliput states)</I>

<BR><A name="statesl"></A><HR size=2 width=55%><BR>

US law seems to be more restrictive (which is obvious, given the way our planet is ruled, 

since the States lead themselves the software industry and therefore 

defend their own interests... software protection laws will probably be much 

more permissive only when the 

new  software will 

be mainly produced by the poor countries), see, for the differences between 

European Union's laws and US' laws , the articles at

Here is an interesting snippet about disassembling and law in the States, 1992<BR><BR>

<FONT color= purple>

Disassembly of Object Code<BR><BR>

     Sega v. Accolade, decided by the Ninth Circuit in 1992, makes clear that, in certain instances, the unauthorized

disassembly of a computer program's object code in order to derive source code is not a copyright infringement. The Ninth

Circuit applied the 'fair use' balancing test to determine that Accolade's use of reverse engineering techniques to produce an

'intermediate copy' of Sega's source code did not constitute copyright infringement. Accolade never distributed the

intermediate copy commercially, but instead used it only to extract unprotectable ideas ‹ a sequence of bytes which act as a

software key ‹ from Sega's game program. This key was then incorporated into Accolade's games, enabling them to 'unlock'

and run on Sega's game platforms. The court cautioned, however, that disassembly involves the making of a literal copy of a

program, and it is permissible only when necessary to extract the unprotectable ideas. It is unclear how far this fair use right

extends.<BR><BR></FONT>



This brings us nowhere... the whole subject seems pretty unregolated as for now... it would be worth to 

examine and "reverse engineer"  (if you are a lawyer or a specialist in applied semantics) the various 

"scarecrow" information that we always find inside all software packages... some of them are so severe 

and unpolite that seem written 

by an Orwellian fanatic or a "Farenheit 451" follower :-). See below about this aspect.

<FONT size=+2>WHY WE CRACK</FONT></CENTER><BR>

Now the "why we crack" part: We are defeating mainly copy protection schemes (but see my two lessons 



on how to completely reverse engineer a Windows 3.1 application) bacause that's fun, and 

this way 

we can get a lot of people on the bandwagon, for the challenge, and because we believe 

firmly that every knowledge (in fact I believe <B>everything</B>) should be free (in the web and in the whole world)... but we 

are doing NOTHING at all compared with that what is <FONT color=blue><U>really</U></FONT> happening around you:<BR>



Every program you can think of can be found on the web, (in

its COMPLETE version many WEEKS before it ever appears in the best shops, as everyone 



with intelligence level "eggplant" soon discovers.<BR>There are obviously differences among

 all the stupid countries of the planet... 

You may want to have a look 

<IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0 width="13" height="13"> 

<A href="javascript:if(confirm('http://www.softwareprotection.com/chart.htm  \n\nThis file was not retrieved by Teleport Pro, because it is addressed on a domain or path outside the boundaries set for its Starting Address.  \n\nDo you want to open it from the server?'))window.location='http://www.softwareprotection.com/chart.htm'" tppabs="http://www.softwareprotection.com/chart.htm">here</A> in order to 

consider where you would be able to buy/produce pirated software or where you should install your server for more "aimed" reverse 

engineering activities or whatever:-)  Besides, since there are "money" and "tax" paradises (and -how funny- nobody makes much  

fuss about that), why shouldn't there exist "software" paradises? (Obvious answer: because money paradises are useful for the rich, software 

paradises would be useful for the poor :-(



<BR><BR>And that's the huge "illegal" 



part of it, but there is also a huge "legal" pirating (forced by the fierce 



concurrence in the software market and by the mere existence of the warez scene on the Web):<BR><BR>



Programs and applications are being now sold on Magazine's CD-ROMs IN THEIR COMPLETE 



VERSION few months after their first appearence for next to nothing... this began in Europe 5 months 



ago and the rithmus



 (and the quality of the software) has increased enormously: I saw some days ago Panzer general 2 complete (CD Player n.19), Ticonderoga



complete (both not at all so old games: late 1996!) Database 5 and <FONT color=blue><U>the 

whole</U></FONT> Lotus set '97 complete and unrestricted (PcPlus 35b, with the 



complete Borland Delphi 1 and the complete "ImagePals" as well)



on various magazine's cd-rom. The same Lotus set was, for instance, sold in its boxes at the 



software retailer for TWENTY times the magazine price, it may sound illogic, but it is 



exactly so... Lotus is scared dead to disappear (thanks to the Micro$oft war against all 



other software producers... funny, there never seem to be any law against this kind of



 actions , btw :-( and Lotus is therefore compelled, like Netscape,  



to give away for free its software just in order to survive... yet even these magazines with 600 megabytes of good software on them every 



month are selling less and less (hence the fierce concurrence) because everything is already on 



the web for free...<BR><BR>And all this is only the top of the Iceberg: Hundred of THOUSAND of 



BBS all around the world push around tons of Megabytes of pirated software, which to day you 



may easily burn on cd-roms in order to distribute them at your friends on your birthday 



party. Cheaper than buying a cake<BR><BR>And that was for the big commercial" software 



companies.  



<U>Shareware</U> programmers are NOT damaged by good crackers (who study assembly and are mostly 



programmers themselves) but by <FONT color=blue><U>themselves</U></FONT>, when they program with useless overbloated languages 



huge toy-applications and by "<FONT color=blue><U>serial numbers aficionados</U></FONT>", people that 



prepare and distribute huge lists with millions of validation codes that you can find everywhere



 on the web.<BR><BR>



On our pages there is not a single pirated copy of software... we do not need pirated copies 



since we are able to crack them in spades anytime we fancy (or to fetch them immediately from 



the web... we don't even need to keep programs on our harddisk any more, would be like 



hoarding leaves in a forest) besides we do not even care much for the software we crack... in fact (apart our 



beloved Softice) we are much more interested in the protection schemes themselves than in 



the software they protect, which most of the time is pure crap. As you'll see in some examples 



of +ORC's tutorial and in many students' essays, we even AMELIORATE the programs we crack.<BR>We do 



not steal, we study, and the software development will soon depend (and in part depends already) 



from the capacities that we (and almost nobody else) are developing: who else if not a



 cracker will in few years time be able to compact and ameliorate already existing, lame applications?



 I believe the society is already changing, and in my opinion the fact that you 



have worked in something like the +HCU will soon open you quite a lot of doors :-) <BR><BR>



As you'll read on the (very important)  



<IMG SRC="bulletr.gif" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/bulletr.gif" ALT="red" ALIGN=CENTER WIDTH=13 HEIGHT=13 BORDER=0 VSPACE=0 HSPACE=0> 



<A href="student.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/student.htm"> student</A> page, one of our problems, is that 



the protection schemes are (mostly) incredibly stupid. That's why we have decided to 



begin writing and devising much stronger protection schemes ourselves... for the challenge and in order 

to improve ourselves, seen that the commercial programmers are 

not able to give us any "cheap thrills" any more... how could they? Most programmers 

seem to work 

for useless money, not for the (very important) pleasure, nor for the only thing that really 

matters in this new age we are already in: <U>knowledge!</U></H4><HR width=44%>

<FONT size=+2> THE SCARECROW AGREEMENT SAGA</FONT></CENTER><BR>

<FONT size=+1>('Legal scarecrow' agreements <U>are NOT</U> legally binding)</FONT><BR>

Most licence agreement (that thing that you click "I agree" on and never read, 

where you agree to give up your first born child and let your sister be 

sold as a slave :-) include a clause that prohibits reverse engineering. A couple of 

examples... 

<FONT color=purple><PRE>

IF YOU AGREE TO THE DISCLAIMER AND LICENSE YOU MAY:



(i) use this software on as many computers as you wish at no charge for 

up to but no more than 30 days. After 30 days of use you must either 

discontinue the use of this software or purchase a registered version 

for each computer that you are going to use this software on.



YOU MAY NOT:



(i) sublicense, rent, sell,  or lease any portion of this software;



(ii) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, modify, translate, 

make any attempt to discover the source code of this software, or 

create derivative works from this software; or



(ii) continue use of this software after your 30 day trial.

allowed to examine... <BR><BR><HR>

Here another example:<FONT color=purple><PRE>

You may not:



* permit other individuals to use the Software except  under  the

  terms listed above;

* permit concurrent use of the Software;

* modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble  or

  create derivative works based on the Software;

TERMINATION



The license will terminate automatically if you  fail  to  comply

with  the limitations described herein.  On termination, you must

destroy all copies of the Software and Documentation.</PRE></FONT>

<BR>

Here there seems to be an interesting possibility. I reverse the 

software. License has been violated and terminate. I then destroy 

all copies of the software, and have then respected the licence. And so 

on <I>ab absurdo</I>. Like the never-ending sentence  

"All crackers are liers, lied the cracker". <HR width=44%>

OK, it is clear that such 'scarecrow' agreements are as 

funny and 

preposterous as you wish, yet of course NOT legally binding. Let's 

demonstrate it <I>ab absurdo</I>: If they were legally binding, then ANY 

agreement of this sort would be, and then anyone, you or me,  

could prepare on his own a small program (I promise that I'll really 

write it myself as soon 

as I find the time) that acts as a small 'wrapper' for all this kind 

of software (I really wish that a good lawjer will correct this 

in 

order to make our own 'legal scarecrows' even more dangerous-looking than 

those used by some softwarehouses...):<FONT color=purple><PRE>

Your software is entering my private computer.

By trespassing this memory point you agree to allow complete possession 

of your software to the legitime owner of this computer, and specifically 

you completely and irrevocabily agree to allow 

any modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble  or

  create derivative works based on this Software that 

the legitime owner of this memory fancies.<BR>

You also declare as void and inexistent any 

other conditions/agreements regarding your software that may preposterously 

be triggered by your software inside 

the RAM hosting you.<BR>

Finally you accept also COMPLETE RESPONSABILITY for any malfunctioning your 

software will have caused to the owner of the hardware you are allow 

to visit -take note- ONLY if you accept this.<BR>

If you don't wish to accept these conditions, please leave immediatly this private 

memory and completely remove you software from this private hardware.<BR>

By trespassing this memory point you have completely agreed to the above. [add 

date with hours, minutes and seconds here] + [Sign with the version name of the 

software]</FONT>

</FONT> <BR><BR>.

Ab absurdo, as I said... yet, see, either both "agreements" are valid or neither 

is... you cannot have the cake and eat it.<BR>I would say that we could keep it this way: anyone 

may reverse the hell out of everything, provided he does not steal or sell 

alien code.<BR>

The only binding texts are the NATIONAL LAWS governing software 

reversing and we have already  seen that 'at least in the European 

Union): 5(3): <FONT color=blue>3. The person having a right to use a copy of a computer program shall be 

   entitled, without the authorization of the rightholder, to observe, study 

   or test the functioning of the program in order to determine the ideas 

   and principles which underlie any element of the program if he does so 

   while performing any of the acts of loading, displaying, running, 

   transmitting or storing the program which he is entitled to do.</FONT>. <BR>

hassle, have a look at my short essay <A href="scarecro.htm" tppabs="http://www.anticrack.de/fravia/scarecro.htm">Scarecrow license agreements and how to defeat them</A>.
