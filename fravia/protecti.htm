Well, dear shareware programmers, if you feel you are advanced enough, and you 

understand now enough this whole cracking stuff (that is, if you have duly 

studied a lot of essays) you may now learn and discuss some nice tricks to block 

any lamer from cracking your code: +RCG has sent for instance a completely new 

"vxd-cryptological" approach to protecting windoze! (You'll find it inside the 

<A href="#anchorsaga">Self32 saga</A>) and there is a new <A href="#anchorheav">heavy</A> 

protection -ready for you to crack and to learn from- as well</I> :-)<BR><BR>



<FONT color=red>14 January 1998, the day after</FONT><BR><I>

Well, Quine has already <A href="#anchorquin">cracked</A> +RCG's 'heavy' protection...</I> :-(

<BR><BR>

<FONT color=red>18 January 1998</FONT></FONT><BR><I>

Well, here are +RCG's new protection ideas, among other things how to take 

softice on a <A href="#anchorboat">boat ride</A> and eventually how to punish 

stupid crackers...</I> :-) 

<HR>

<FONT size=+2>

<FONT color=red>Old intro (May 1997)</FONT></FONT><BR>

Well, here we go... This whole section is a (very clever) idea from +Rcg<BR>

+Rcg's is not a native English speaker (nor am I), 

and therefore bear with us some language imperfections, as usual only content 

 matters (read knowledge), 

form and frills may wait. This section could develop and be VERY IMPORTANT for 

our work, provided many of you will send contributions...<BR><BR>

This "protection schemes" section should be very useful for shareware 

programmers too, in their fight against "moron-pirates" (against real 

crackers they have of course no chance). The survival of the 

shareware programmers, strange as it may seem, is OUR CONCERN, as +Rcg 

explains in his approach... the only enemy of humanity is Micro$oft!<BR>

This is the reason we ask SPECIALLY shareware programmers to help 

in this section... strange isn't it? Crackers and Shareware programmers 

fighting together... when the crocodile comes, cats and dogs form alliances.

<FONT color=red>Quine's Quick Qrack</FONT></FONT></CENTER>

And on 15 January 1998 -a day after having released +RCG's heavy protection- I 

have already received a 

quick solution by nothing less than Quine. +RCG, my friend, I believe we will have 

to start to 

prepare "specific" protections against +HCUkers... the 

only question is: how?<PRE><FONT color=purple>fravia+,



	In taking a break from putting the finishing touches on my HASP

essay (!), I took a look at +RCG's heavy.exe.  It was quite interesting

because his method has weaknesses that are similar to those I found

with the hasp encryption.  The solution, by the way, is to create a

10h byte long file called key.dat which contains 00h through 0Fh.  The

key, as +RCG tells us is too easy, but even with a completely random

key of 10h bytes it would have taken about 2 minutes to find it.  I'm

not going to explain how I figured out that it was a 10h byte string

xor'd with the code from 4012B9h to 401300h because it's fairly easy

to figure that out.  Here's how to find the key.  Isolate the

encrypted bytes in their own file, load that file in HexWorkshop, and

print it out.  You Should have something that looks like this:



00000000 6A31 6A51 2545 066D 08E1 A30A 0C0D 66F7

00000010 2041 02FC 710D EEFD 0809 0AB5 B51F 4E0F

00000020 8934 5223 4405 B906 1B49 0A20 F284 3343

00000030 2041 02BD 6025 4607 813C 422B 4C0D C90A

00000040 4421 4203 0B05 0607



Isn't it convenient how it's lined up so that the first byte of the

key is xor'd with the first byte in each of the rows, and so on with

the second, third, ....  I will refer to bytes in the grid above by

their row and column using hexadecimal and starting with 0.  So, (0,0)

is the first byte and (4,7) is the last.  Ok, here's the weakness of

+RCG's method:  he left the relocation table untouched and there are 9

relocations within the encrypted code.  A relocation entails a four

byte absolute address, usually into the data section.  IDA, to make

things convenient, tells us where these relocations are after we make

the encrypted code undefined.  We know that these addresses will start

with at least 0040 and most of them with 004020 (since that's where

the data section is).  The addresses are at: (0,0), (0,f), (1,c),

(2,2), (2,7), (2,f), (3,4), (3,a), (4,0).  Even if we assume only that

they all start with 0040, that means that we can deduce all but bytes

0, 3, 8, and b of the key right off the bat.  Working on the 004020

assumption (which is correct in all but one case) we can deduce

everything except for byte 8 (needless to say, I had seen the pattern

way before this, but I wanted to explain how it would work for any

key).  However, since we know everything else at this point it would

be fairly simple work to deduce byte 8.  I address a lot of issues

related to this in the hasp essay (they use a 1000h byte long string

for xor'ing) and suggest a more airtight protection method.



P.S.  A further consequence of +RCG's neglect of relocations is that

the program will crash if it is ever relocated by the operating

system.  This is not bound to happen to an exe, but it is extremely

likely with a dll, in which case the operating system will start

adding values to bytes within the encrypted code and that will lead to

an inevitable crash.

<I>Not everybody agrees with "higher language" protections... here a letter

my site know that Madmax! is NOT 'a nobody' :-)</I><PRE><FONT color=purple>

heya fravia+,



its madmax here...i just wanted to comment on the Protecti project, many

of us crackers are a little discouraged about the format involved

here..To have such protectionists that crackers are to write a scheme in

a high level language is rather unfair i'd think...After briefly viewing

over +sync's test, i was afraid to see call after call of manipulating

code..So, i just think that any test for crackers should be written in

Assembly...To further prove my point, I could simply load up Visual

Basic 5(dont hate me for saying that =) and make a simple routine that

would be near impossible to trace...Think about it please...BTW: I

represent some cracker's from IRC also that have agreed, so consider it

please!



see ya,

madmax!</FONT></PRE>

<I>Well, what do YOU say about this matter? Any questions/advices/propositions?

<BR>Madmax! is right, as much as an assembly 'pure' good protection is much 

more difficult to hyde inside calls after calls of overbloated code. Yet I believe 

that for instance +RCG's 'heavy' protection proves that you can write a (fairly) 

good protection scheme in windoze, using an exe and a vxd that together sum to 

less than 15.000 bytes (OK, OK, I know, 15.000 bytes are quite a lot already). 

Besides, like it or not, most "programmers" out there would not know how 

to program in assembly anyway, and are lobotomized by the overbloated programming 

'languages' of to-days 'frilly' trends, so they need some protection too, don't they?

<BR>

Well, what do YOU say about this matter? Any questions/advices/propositions?

</I><HR>

Here is sanity_sync's answer (15 January 1998):<PRE><FONT color=purple>

I say:



your point is well stated. it makes sense not to program cracker

protections in assembly because that is not the kind of experience 

crackers need at this time (unless they are cracking dos apps).

can i make some recommendations for your protecti.htm page? 

Here's what i would like to see:



   stages of protection- ie; easy, medium, difficult, expert

   we need stages in courses like these, and we need to show

   not only HOW to write good protections, but give good SOLUTIONS,

   so a beginner can see how it was cracked, and so crackers

   can practice at whatever skill level they choose. In other

   words, not only improving the quality of the protection but

   also the quality of the cracker! a step by step will make the

   learning curve MUCH easier.
